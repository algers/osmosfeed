          "description": "<p> Incident began at <strong>2023-07-06 22:22</strong> and ended at <strong>2023-07-11 02:19</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class=\"cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text\"><h1>Incident Report</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, 6 July 2023, Gmail experienced elevated errors in some of its core functionalities due to internal task issues. This occurred for 1 hour and 27 minutes starting at 15:22 PT. On Monday, 10 July 2023, the impact reoccurred for a period of 42 minutes between 18:37 to 19:19. During the period of impact,  some Gmail users experienced intermittent unavailability to a number of services, including syncing email to their clients, uploading attachments, initial page loads, and email deliveries. To our Gmail users who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform‚Äôs performance and availability.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Gmail uses an internal triggering process system, built on an internal Spanner queue receiver, to perform asynchronous processing of the incoming messages in the Gmail backend.</p>\n<p>The root cause of the incident is due to an unintended configuration change made in one of the internal proxy layers that handles Spanner queue receivers. However, it inadvertently reduced the callback size limit of the Spanner queue receiver resulting in throttling of the queue, which caused elevated memory pressure of the backend servers while handling the backlog of messages.</p>\n<p>Google engineers mitigated the issue by rolling back the incorrect change and performed a controlled release of the messages to ensure the backend servers were resourced.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>On Thursday July 6, 2023 at 15:22, Google engineers were alerted to the issue from the monitoring tools in place, and started working on multiple mitigation strategies to restore the service.</p>\n<p>There was a spike in traffic from a single problematic trigger, which caused memory pressures on the backend servers. Google engineers paused the processing of this trigger and implemented temporary throttles and began to slowly ramp up the processing of this trigger to clean up the backlog of tasks.</p>\n<p>On Monday July 10, 2023, Google engineers noticed that an incorrect configuration change had been rolled out after the issue on Thursday that caused a recurrence. Google engineers implemented a controlled ramp of the processing of the trigger, similar to the mitigation that was performed on July 6. However, one partition of production traffic was missed during this procedure and caused follow-on impact starting at 18:47. To prevent further user impact, engineers paused the processing of the trigger again, and as a result user impact began to subside at around 19:15. Google engineers performed cleanup of this trigger at a controlled pace over the course of the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future. Google engineers have set up a conservative limit for throttling the incoming load. This is to ensure the memory utilization is within the limits.</p>\n<p>Google is also completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement additional safeguards around change management while system improvements are being developed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, 6 July 2023 between 15:15 and 16:47 PT, a portion of Gmail users experienced some IMAP unavailability, which resulted in asynchronous syncing issues between their clients and their mailboxes. Users may have experienced errors when syncing mail and with settings in their clients, issues with initial page loads, one or more errors accessing Gmail‚Äôs external API through the API Server, an inbound delivery delay, or an outbound delay.</p>\n<p>On Monday, 10 July 2023 between 18:37 and 19:19, a portion of Gmail users received errors attempting to sync their clients to their mailboxes, upload attachments and load ads, or load their web client for the first time. Meanwhile some users experienced IMAP errors, errors from Sync Server, and unavailability when accessing the API Server. Email delivery was also impacted, with some inbound emails temporarily delayed.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Gmail</p>",
