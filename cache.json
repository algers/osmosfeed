A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.\nWhat happened?\nMicrosoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware. This caused\nDefender to quarantine the binaries, meaning they could not run.\nWe submitted Tailscale 1.46.1 to Microsoft to investigate the false positive,\nwho then updated Defender to avoid flagging this release as malware at\n2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC.\nWho is affected?\nPeople using Defender and Tailscale 1.46.1.\nWhat is the impact?\nTailscale will not run on affected machines.\nWhat do I need to do?\nTo resolve this issue on your own tailnet, you can take either or both of 2\napproaches:\nUpdate to a newer version of Tailscale. Newer versions are not affected by this problem.\nCreate an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.\nUpdate Microsoft Defender.",

During the incident, approximately 9% of pull requests (less than the 20% first reported) experienced staleness of up to 7m. The root cause was identified to be an increase in the latency of a downstream dependency causing pull request workers to saturate their available capacity, resulting in delayed updates to PRs - no data was lost during this incident.\n\tWe mitigated this by adding additional capacity to the affected worker pool at 15:02 UTC. This allowed our background jobs to catch up with the backlog of updates and provide relief to our customers. Additionally, we have significantly increased the performance of the downstream service to prevent recurrence\nOct  9, 14:52 UTC\nUpdate - We are investigating delays for commits showing up on Pull Requests page loads in the web UI.
