Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.\n\r\n\r\nWe found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. \n\r\n\r\nWe restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. \n\r\n\r\nWe're continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.",
