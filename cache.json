(the \"dot\" at the end may be required depending on your domain).\n(example for your main domain: www.yourwebsite.com)\nYou can also add an addon domain without using www if you want your website to be reachable this way, (example: yourwebsite.com).\nIn order to do that, you can configure an A record (Aname) in your DNS zone pointing to one of the following IP addresses:\n13.248.140.34\n\n\n76.223.14.214\n\n\nThese are the new addresses that are replacing the previous address: (52.210.201.133)\nImportant note, If you are using 52.210.201.133, you need to change to one of the new IP address as we will not be able to keep supporting this one on March 29th 2023.\nIf you need assistance doing this change, please contact our support team and we will be happy to assist you with the modifications. Please make sure to have access to your registrar (Gandi, OVH, Godaddy…) so we can assist you in performing this change. \nThe details are also available on our manual.\nThanks,",
