          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device\nreauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to\nlose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.\nWhat happened?\nThe logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an\nalready-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the\ndevice’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s\nidentity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without\nany tags.\nThe bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on\n2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.\nWho is affected?\n189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either\ndirectly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast\nuser switching to switch between multiple\ntailnets.\nWe have notified affected organizations where we have security\ncontacts.\nWhat is the impact?\nDevices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the\ndevice’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,\nor the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the\ndevice. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab\nof the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this\ncould change the device’s network permissions.\nWe have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of\ndeliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect\noutcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIf you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were\ncontacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the\nadmin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix\nto the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected\norganizations.",

          "description": "Issue Summary:\n\r\nOn April 20th, 2023 from 6:00 AM PDT until 7:45 AM PDT, a small number of users experienced latency issues when using Slack. Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. \n\r\n\r\nThe issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. \n\r\n\r\nOur team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience while we worked through this. We apologize for any disruption to your work.",
