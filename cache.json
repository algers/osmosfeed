          "description": "<p> Incident began at <strong>2022-12-13 05:30</strong> and ended at <strong>2022-12-13 17:50</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class=\"cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text\"><h1>Incident Report</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>On Monday, 12 December 2022 at 21:30 US/Pacific, some Google Meet users experienced issues joining livestreams globally for a duration of 12 hours and 20 minutes. The issue did not impact iOS users of Meet. To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have conducted an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the resiliency of our service.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Google Meet livestream allows Meet customers to stream meetings to a large number of viewers. It relies on the YouTube streaming infrastructure and the YouTube player to view livestreams in the browser.</p>\n<p>The trigger of the incident was a recent software update, which introduced an issue that resulted in the video player failing to recognize Meet livestreams and failing to start live playbacks. The change was initially pushed to 1% of users, and after monitoring for a period of time with no issues observed, Google engineers followed established practices and pushed the change to 100% of users in production.</p>\n<p>Errors that occurred during this period, however, were missed during the initial rollout, because our monitoring did not properly incorporate signals from Meet&#39;s player. Once the change was pushed to 100%, the issue&#39;s frequency increased. The errors that occurred due to the change also led to additional internal API traffic due to retry behaviors, which overloaded our servers.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were notified of the issue through a customer support case on Tuesday, 13 December at 03:12 US/Pacific and immediately began an investigation. Once the scope of the issue became clear, the incident was escalated at 04:53. The incident was further escalated to the YouTube team at 07:44. At 09:20, the root cause was identified, and engineers initiated a rollback of the software update. The incident was fully mitigated at 09:50, once the rollback completed.</p>\n<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a fix for the video player retry loop in the Meet player to prevent request overload.</li>\n<li>Implement monitoring and alerting to detect failures to connect to livestreams in Meet and reduce mitigation time for issues of this type.</li>\n<li>Investigate an alternative live streaming platform for Meet and remove dependency on YouTube.</li>\n<li>Enhance testing in the staging environment to identify and prevent regressions before rollout progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>On Monday, 12 December 2022 from 21:30 to Tuesday, 13 December at 09:50 PT, some Google Meet users experienced issues joining livestreams globally.</p>\n<h3>Google Meet</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Android and Web Google Meet clients experienced errors, which resulted in a retry loop behavior for the Meet broadcast players.</li>\n<li>Some users would continue to see the error after the rollback completed, as a browser refresh would be required.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Meet</p>",

Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. It was discovered that a majority of this traffic was coming from nefarious acting workspaces issuing too many app download link SMS requests to the Twilio service. With thousands of workspaces doing this at the same time, our queue became overloaded. The disposable email domains used to create these teams were added to a Total Ban blocklist preventing any users using the domains from accessing Slack ‚Äî stopping team creation and further SMS pumping. Twilio was also able to drop the messages specific to app download links based on a content filter. With these actions, the queue was able to catch back up.",
