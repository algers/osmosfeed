Access to\ncertain system files (such as /etc/shadow on Linux) can then be used to obtain\nfull administrative control over the host.\nWhat do I need to do?\nOn Windows 10 and later, upgrade to Tailscale 1.52 (released 30 October\n2023) or later, which resolves the issue.\nOn Windows 7 and 8, upgrade to Tailscale 1.44.3 (released 8 Jan\n2024), which resolves the issue.\nOn Linux, upgrade to 1.54 (released 15 November 2023) or later,\nwhich resolves the issue.\nThe best practice is to run the latest stable version, which as of this writing\nis 1.56.1. Consider turning on automatic updates.\nUse Tailscale ACLs to control the availability of Funnel.",

This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in c…",

The average hook processing delay is approximately 3 hours.\nDec 20, 12:31 CET\nIdentified - We have taken the necessary steps to stabilize the situation and started processing the queue of hooks at a faster pace. The main issue still persists and shared hooks are currently being processed with a significant delay.\nDec 20, 11:08 CET\nUpdate - Our engineers are currently pursuing two hypotheses with the goal to remediate the issue. We will post another update latest in an hour.\nDec 20, 09:40 CET\nInvestigating - The issue still persists and shared hooks are being processed with a delay.
