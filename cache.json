After releasing the new calendar interface, many of you reacted, we thank you for that, and we heard your feedbacks ! \nWe did some evolutions to adapt the calendar new interface and make it match your needs. \nWhat are the main evolutions?\n1- More listings displayed\nIn the first version of new calendar interface the planning was limited to 25 properties, now it goes up to 100 properties.\n2- The filters\nFew hours after the release we enabled all the 8 filters !\n3- The logos more visible\nThe logos of the sources are now colored in white, it makes them more visible \nSmall tip💡\nSome of you need to visualize more properties on the planning view.\nIf you zoom out your calendar page you can make the lines thinner and be able to see more properties.\n\nWe invite you to discover all these evolutions, and hope it will help you to have a better management of your calendar, save more time, and make more bookings !\nWishing you all a pleasant day!",

Some customers may have also had trouble with loading channels, adding users to group direct messages, API hyperlink rendering, and missing Saved items.\n\r\n\r\nA mass de-provisioning event inadvertently increased load across our infrastructure, causing issues with Threads for many users. \n\r\n\r\nAs an immediate mitigation strategy, we temporarily deactivated the Threads view for all users. \n\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we ended the long running de-provisioning jobs, and significantly scaled up the systems that handle those jobs. We also made several code changes to reduce the effect a de-provisioning job of this scale would have on our infrastructure, and redistributed some of the load across other parts of the system. \n\r\n\r\nThe optimisation and redistribution work brought error rates down, which resolved most of the issues with channel loading, group direct messages, hyperlinks, and Saved items that users were experiencing. \n\r\n\r\nAt this point, we made the call not to re-enable the Threads view in order to give our recovery efforts more time to restore balance to the system. \n\r\n\r\nOnce the load was appropriately balanced across our infrastructure, and we were able to confirm that our up-scaling systems were prepared to handle any future spikes, we re-enabled the Threads view for all users.",
