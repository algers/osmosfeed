This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.\nWho is affected?\nAll Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.\nWhat should I do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\nWhat is the impact?\nAn attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.\nReviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Emily Trau and Jamie McClymont (CyberCX) for reporting this issue.

Emails are placed in a queue and are processed by a set of backend services (e.g. spam classification). If everything goes well, the mail delivery system sends the emails. However, when a failure occurs, the system keeps the emails in the queue and retries delivering them later.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>On 10 December 2022 at 05:29 PT, some Gmail users observed email delivery delays of 60 minutes on average, as well as email bounce backs (i.e. senders received a delivery failure notification).</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>An email campaign from a single domain triggered a latent bug in one of the dependencies of the email delivery service, which crashed and then became overloaded. These emails contained dynamic mail content triggering service instance failures.  Due to this failure and a latent bug validation feature configuration, 80% of tasks crashed, which overloaded the remaining tasks.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>On 10 December 2022 at 05:29 PT, Google Engineering was alerted to an issue via internal monitoring that Gmail delivery was impacted. Google Engineering began investigating and identified the following actions to mitigate the issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase the memory of the affected dependency.</li>\n<li>Disable the feature that triggered the issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The backlog of emails were then able to to be processed without any additional issues.</p>\n<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit Gmail delivery dependencies.</li>\n<li>Optimize the email validation feature configuration.</li>\n<li>Implement automatic threshold protection against backlog overload.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Gmail</p>",

Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. It was discovered that a majority of this traffic was coming from nefarious acting workspaces issuing too many app download link SMS requests to the Twilio service. With thousands of workspaces doing this at the same time, our queue became overloaded. The disposable email domains used to create these teams were added to a Total Ban blocklist preventing any users using the domains from accessing Slack ‚Äî stopping team creation and further SMS pumping. Twilio was also able to drop the messages specific to app download links based on a content filter. With these actions, the queue was able to catch back up.",
