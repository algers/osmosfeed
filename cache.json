From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a configuration change that prevented resources (new or changes to existing resources) from synchronizing with a backend system used for authorizing requests. This resulted in 403 errors for attempted changes to these resources. The total outage duration was 16 hours and 32 minutes.
