To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have conducted an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the resiliency of our service.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The issue was caused by an unanticipated increase in traffic to the internal user ID management system used by multiple Google Workspace products. Upon further investigation, we identified that the overwhelming amount of traffic resulted from erroneous changes made to update the membership details from one of the upstream systems.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to this issue through automated monitoring, which also blocked the incoming traffic simultaneously within a few minutes. However, the high traffic during this period impacted downstream services.</p>\n<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the design in the internal user ID management system to not remove users, unless mentioned explicitly as allowed.</li>\n<li>Introduce multiple redundancies in the system, including self-throttling auto-kill mechanisms in the involved systems to keep the traffic under a defined threshold.</li>\n<li>Introduce robust control and process reviews for data changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.</p>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>On Tuesday, 13 December 2022 between 07:34 and 10:04 PT, various Google Workspace products (noted below) experienced impact in their services:</p>\n<h3>Google Chat</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Some users observed incorrect status indicators representing their presence and typing status.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Google Voice</h3>\n<p>Users experienced impact in various telephony services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some SMS messages were delayed by an average of 1.2 minutes.</li>\n<li>A limited number of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) registrations were not completed. Affected user devices may have been temporarily unable to place or receive calls.</li>\n<li>Active call queue processing was delayed, which may have resulted in delayed call history, billing, or voicemail delivery for some users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gmail</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A few users experienced intermittent issues signing in and temporary errors.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Chat</p>",

Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. It was discovered that a majority of this traffic was coming from nefarious acting workspaces issuing too many app download link SMS requests to the Twilio service. With thousands of workspaces doing this at the same time, our queue became overloaded. The disposable email domains used to create these teams were added to a Total Ban blocklist preventing any users using the domains from accessing Slack — stopping team creation and further SMS pumping. Twilio was also able to drop the messages specific to app download links based on a content filter. With these actions, the queue was able to catch back up.",
