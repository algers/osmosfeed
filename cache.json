During the disruption, users were able to access course pages by uninstalling and reinstalling the Classroom iOS app.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The root cause has been identified as a bug, triggered by an update released for Classroom iOS, that caused an issue with the local database migration. This caused the iOS app to not load properly when users attempted to access course pages with attached materials, as the migration was specific to the materials configuration.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to the issue via internal monitoring on 24 July 2023 at 07:50 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers reproduced the issue,  identified the trigger as a failed database migration, and paused the auto update. This prevented any further disruption. An app update with a fix was released for the Classroom iOS app, thereby resolving the issue on 26 July 2023 at 04:15 US/Pacific. Users who had already updated to the problematic app version were advised to either uninstall and reinstall or update the app to the version with the fix.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement additional pre-release migration and application testing plans to validate app stability</li>\n</ul>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Classroom</p>",

A small percentage of customers may have also experienced errors or slowness when loading channels, sending messages, accessing admin pages, and connecting to Slack.\n\r\n\r\nAn issue with a routine database cluster migration inadvertently caused a decrease in capacity. Unfortunately, this coincided with a scheduled job to process a large number of custom status requests, an activity that commonly occurs at the top of each hour. The number of incoming requests exceeded the unintentionally reduced capacity of the database cluster, leading to errors and sluggishness for some actions in Slack. As these requests piled up, other Slack services began to experience issues as well, including a small number of users being unable to connect.\n\r\n\r\nWe paused the scheduled custom status job to immediately mitigate the load on the affected database cluster. This resolved some of the errors affecting Slack services. Once we established we had sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled job, we resumed processing the custom status requests, fully restoring normal service for all affected users.\n\r\n\r\nOnce the load was balanced and custom status processing had returned to normal, we deployed a fix to correct the issue with the database cluster migration, bringing capacity back to the expected level.",

They were incorrectly displaying an error \"This message contains interactive elements\".\n\r\n\r\nAs we looked into it further, we traced the problem to a formatting issue, which resulted in missing metadata for the messages sent. Reverting a recent change fixed the issue for all affected customers.",
