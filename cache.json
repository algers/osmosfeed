These users may have seen “500 Internal” errors when trying to access Calendar on the web main page and while interacting with events for a duration of 3 hours and 15 minutes.  This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>A recent update to Google Calendar triggered an unintended bug that slowed down the service. This was compounded by an increase in invalid internet Calendar Scheduling (ICS) from Gmail to Calendar. As a result, some users may have seen intermittent 500 internal errors while using Google Calendar.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to this issue via internal monitoring on 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers mitigated the issue by scaling up Calendar resources and filtering traffic reaching Calendar backends. In addition, we rolled back the recent change in ICS file processing, resulting in traffic returning to normal levels. The issue was fully resolved on 21 Sept at 09:30 US/Pacific.</p>\n<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimize internal triggers for early performance degradation detection.</li>\n<li>Isolate heavy performance processing to dedicated infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>On 21 Sept from 06:30 to 09:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Calendar web users experienced intermittent error rates when accessing Calendar, leading to some users not being able to see their event information updated on Calendar.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Calendar</p>",

During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.\n\tWe mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC. We have additional repair items in place to prevent a recurrence in the future.\nSep 27, 00:23 UTC\nInvestigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions",
