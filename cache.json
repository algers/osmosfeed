A fix has been put in place and we've confirmed that DNS resolution is now functioning normally.\nWe're now monitoring the situation and will post an update shortly once we confirm full resolution of this incident.\nMonitoring: May 09, 2023 - 02:49 UTC\n-\nOur Engineering team is investigating user reports of services in our SFO1 region being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. This includes running commands on Droplets that utilize DNS lookups, such as \"wget\" and \"apt update\", etc. Inbound network connections to services should still be operating normally. \nThank you for your patience as our team works to understand the root cause of the issue.

This resulted in 403 errors for attempted changes to these resources. The total outage duration was 16 hours and 32 minutes.
