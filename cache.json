This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.\nWho is affected?\nAll Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.\nWhat should I do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\nWhat is the impact?\nAn attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.\nReviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Emily Trau and Jamie McClymont (CyberCX) for reporting this issue.
