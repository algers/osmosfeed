The issue was caused due to the decision of the Government of Chile to delay the time change by a week from 3 September 2022 to 10 September 2022.</p>\n<p>Following the announcement of the Chilean Governmentâ€™s decision on 8 August 2022, Google product teams evaluated options to minimize customer impact. After careful analysis, the Calendar product team decided to not roll out an ad-hoc fix due to the number of variables involved with the fix roll out. So, the Google team published an <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/es-419/actualizaciones-de-producto/android-chrome-play/chile-preparandonos-para-la-mejor-experiencia-frente-al-cambio-de-hora/\">external blog post</a> on 1 September 2022, outlining the Governmentâ€™s decision to delay the time change and workarounds to prepare the customers in Chile for the best time change experience.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving multiple customer escalations on 5 September 2022, the product team reconvened and decided to roll out the emergency fix to mitigate the impact to our customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>Events  in the calendar for the week of 3 September 2022 to 10 September 2022 were not in the right time for users who have events saved in the Chilean time zone or if the user&#39;s calendar is set to Chile time zone.\nCurrent time displayed on the customers calendars is an hour later than the actual time.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Calendar</p>",
