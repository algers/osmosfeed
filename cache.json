An interaction between two feature flag rollouts caused us to suppress delivery of push webhooks between 16:23 and 17:11 UTC in a manner that evaded our existing observability. This affected 71,000 repositories whose users will have noted missing webhook deliveries and/or experienced Actions jobs with push triggers failing to start. During this period, around 25% of new Actions jobs were impacted. The issues were resolved by disabling one of the feature flags in question.\nAfter weighing various options for retroactively dispatching old push webhooks, we concluded that the risk of delivering stale data to customers with these redeliveries outweighed the possible benefit.\nAs follow up to this incident, we are working to improve monitoring of webhook throughput and to document a policy around webhook redelivery timelines.\nNov 28, 17:59 UTC\nUpdate - Actions is operating normally.\nNov 28, 17:36 UTC\nUpdate - Customers saw pull requests push event deliveries for Actions and Webhooks fail between 16:23 and 17:12 (UTC).

After a quick mitigation, we began to see recovery on the job queues by 10:02 UTC. During this time window 100% of Actions jobs were delayed in starting for up to 11 minutes.\nUnfortunately, the rapid queue recovery sent a thundering herd of jobs to Actions hosted runner pools, causing a database deadlock that resulted in some hosted runner pools having increased latency when accepting new jobs. This affected only a small percentage of overall jobs, around 2%. Configuration changes led to a resolution and the system was fully recovered by 11:27 UTC and all in progress jobs were processed.\nThe incident is now resolved.\nNov 21, 11:12 UTC\nUpdate - We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.\nNov 21, 10:24 UTC\nUpdate - We have recovery for the underlying issue but are waiting for Actions queues to catch up. We expect this to be completed in less than 1 hour(s).\nNov 21, 10:11 UTC\nInvestigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions",
