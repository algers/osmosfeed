          "description": "Description: We resolved an information disclosure vulnerability in the\nhello.ts.net service.\nWhat happened?\nOn January 15 2024, we became aware of a potential information disclosure\nvulnerability in the hello.ts.net service, which could show the identity of a\ndifferent Tailscale user when loaded. The hello.ts.net service receives\nidentity information and public keys of nodes tied to their IP address. On\nNovember 28 2023, we made a change to how IPs are assigned to\nTailscale nodes, making them globally non-unique. When the Tailscale service\nassigned the same IP to multiple nodes, hello.ts.net would receive identity\ninformation for one of the nodes at random. We confirmed on January 26 2024\nthat, if one of the other nodes with that IP loaded hello.ts.net, they would\nsee another user's name, email, and hostname.\nThe Tailscale Security Team immediately took hello.ts.net offline while the\nfix was in progress. The issue has been fixed and the hello.ts.net service\nwas restored on January 29 2024.\nWho was affected?\nThe incident was isolated to 10 users across 9 tailnets who could have had\ntheir information leaked to other Tailscale users. We notified the tailnet\nsecurity contacts directly in accordance with our obligations under applicable\ndata privacy laws. Due to the random nature of the vulnerability, we cannot\nconfirm that all of those users were indeed affected.\nRegular shared nodes always see unique node IPs and were not\nvulnerable in a manner similar to hello.ts.net.\nWhat was the impact?\nA small number of users had their name, email, and hostname potentially exposed\nto other Tailscale users that had nodes sharing the same IP.\nIn addition, the hello.ts.net service was offline between January 26-29\n2024. Several users reported being negatively impacted by this.\nWhat do I need to do?\nNo action is needed at this time.\nIf you have a dependency on hello.ts.net as a probing target for Tailscale\nconnectivity, consider using a different probing\nmechanism.",

          "description": "Jan 31, 14:57 UTC\nResolved - This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.\nThe change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.\nFor example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.\nWe have so far identified three remediation items here:\n- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.\n- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.\n- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.\nJan 31, 14:56 UTC\nUpdate - We have resolved the issue and confirmed all regions are now operating as expected.\nJan 31, 14:49 UTC\nUpdate - The fix for ip allow lists is currently rolling out; and we are awaiting confirmation from specific geographic regions.\nJan 31, 14:33 UTC\nUpdate - We are rolling out a fix to resolve the issues with IP allow lists. This should be resolved shortly.\nJan 31, 14:14 UTC\nUpdate - Some customers are experiencing issues with IP allow lists.\nJan 31, 14:14 UTC\nInvestigating - We are currently investigating this issue.",

This incident impacted, at peak time 6% of the requests for viewing Avatars. Requests that were impacted did not prevent the users from continuing to use any GitHub services.

We fixed the bug and reset the backend cache to pull new data, which initially fixed the issue around 4:00 PM PST on February 6. However, some users began experiencing the problem again once their Slack client refreshed.\n\r\n\r\nWe continued investigating the issue, tracing it back to a piece of code that would push older image data to a database that housed profile information, and promptly reverted the incorrect code which resolved the issue for all affected users.",
