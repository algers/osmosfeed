In a highly unlikely situation, where we lose power to both the supplies, the Droplets in FRA1 may experience downtime for a brief period. We will endeavor to keep this to a minimum for the duration of the change.\nIf you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket\nThank you,\nTeam DigitalOcean",
