          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device\nreauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to\nlose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.\nWhat happened?\nThe logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an\nalready-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the\ndevice’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s\nidentity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without\nany tags.\nThe bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on\n2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.\nWho is affected?\n189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either\ndirectly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast\nuser switching to switch between multiple\ntailnets.\nWe have notified affected organizations where we have security\ncontacts.\nWhat is the impact?\nDevices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the\ndevice’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,\nor the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the\ndevice. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab\nof the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this\ncould change the device’s network permissions.\nWe have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of\ndeliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect\noutcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIf you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were\ncontacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the\nadmin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix\nto the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected\norganizations.",

          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed tailnets created by GitHub organizations which were subsequently renamed to be associated with a new GitHub organization with the previous name.\nWhat happened?\nTailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.\nWho is affected?\nUp to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name.
