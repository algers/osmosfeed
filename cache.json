An interaction between two feature flag rollouts caused us to suppress delivery of push webhooks between 16:23 and 17:11 UTC in a manner that evaded our existing observability. This affected 71,000 repositories whose users will have noted missing webhook deliveries and/or experienced Actions jobs with push triggers failing to start. During this period, around 25% of new Actions jobs were impacted. The issues were resolved by disabling one of the feature flags in question.\nAfter weighing various options for retroactively dispatching old push webhooks, we concluded that the risk of delivering stale data to customers with these redeliveries outweighed the possible benefit.\nAs follow up to this incident, we are working to improve monitoring of webhook throughput and to document a policy around webhook redelivery timelines.\nNov 28, 17:59 UTC\nUpdate - Actions is operating normally.\nNov 28, 17:36 UTC\nUpdate - Customers saw pull requests push event deliveries for Actions and Webhooks fail between 16:23 and 17:12 (UTC).

Due to an error in the certificate formatting, we uploaded an invalid certificate configuration that was not observed in our pre-production testing. Our background job servers were unable to start because a valid configuration is required at worker start up. As a result, users experienced delays in Pull Requests, Webhooks, Issues, Actions and Projects. Rollback of the change was slowed by the invalid certificate as our deployment system relied on the same certificate. Rollback was completed at 20:35 UTC.

          "description": "Nov 21, 11:27 UTC\nResolved - On November 21, 2023, at 09:50 UTC GitHub Actions jobs encountered delays due to an incident in our background job service caused by excessive rebalancing in a Kafka consumer group. After a quick mitigation, we began to see recovery on the job queues by 10:02 UTC. During this time window 100% of Actions jobs were delayed in starting for up to 11 minutes.\nUnfortunately, the rapid queue recovery sent a thundering herd of jobs to Actions hosted runner pools, causing a database deadlock that resulted in some hosted runner pools having increased latency when accepting new jobs. This affected only a small percentage of overall jobs, around 2%. Configuration changes led to a resolution and the system was fully recovered by 11:27 UTC and all in progress jobs were processed.\nThe incident is now resolved.\nNov 21, 11:12 UTC\nUpdate - We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.\nNov 21, 10:24 UTC\nUpdate - We have recovery for the underlying issue but are waiting for Actions queues to catch up. We expect this to be completed in less than 1 hour(s).\nNov 21, 10:11 UTC\nInvestigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions",

Access to this repo was paused while load was re-rerouted, mitigating the problem.\nThe conditions that triggered the expensive operations have been identified and refactored.\nNov 15, 11:33 UTC\nUpdate - Error rates and performance have returned to normal.\nNov 15, 11:21 UTC\nUpdate - We have identified the source of the issue and have removed the additional load from the service. Sporadic delays in pull request experiences and intermittent 500s are still occurring and impacting a very small percentage of traffic. Next update is expected within 30 minutes.\nNov 15, 11:04 UTC\nUpdate - We are seeing connectivity issues between some of our systems and git backend services. This is causing intermittent error responses and delays in pull request experiences for a very small percentage of traffic. We are investigating mitigations and expect to provide another update within 30 minutes.\nNov 15, 09:50 UTC\nInvestigating - We are currently investigating this issue.",

Affected customers may have also had trouble sending messages and running some workflows.\n\r\n\r\nOne of our databases experienced a minor hardware issue. This triggered an automatic intervention from our redundancy systems, and a new database was brought into service. However, the new database entered a state where it could not successfully respond to incoming queries.\n\r\n\r\nAs an immediate mitigation step, we performed a manual replacement and redirected the incoming queries to a third database.
