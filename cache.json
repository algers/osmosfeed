This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.\nWho is affected?\nUp to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name.

Some customers had to perform a manual reboot (occasionally several times), to overcome this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional details:</strong></p>\n<p>Customers were provided with a temporary workaround with specific steps to overcome the issue.
