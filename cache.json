The actual failover is estimated to take less than 3 seconds.\nExisting infrastructure, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, should continue running without issue. There is no network disruption to existing services expected as part of this maintenance. However, there are dependencies on multiple services. During the failover, there may be customer impacts that should be brief and transitory. The following actions may experience increased latency or failure rates during the maintenance period:\n- API calls to the DigitalOcean public API \n- Events for Droplets and Droplet-based services such as create, delete, power on/off, resize, etc \n- Control operations through the DigitalOcean Cloud Control Panel \nMultiple teams will be engaged to keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate any impact that does occur.

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform‚Äôs performance and availability.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>Google Workspace products expose settings through the Admin Console that Customer Admins can group together to create policies that govern how their users interact with Workspace products and services.</p>\n<p>When a Customer Admin makes changes to policy settings in Admin Console, those changes are processed by a compilation server, which computes effective settings for the applicable entities. This process includes optimizations to avoid the repeated processing of multiple changes that affect the same set of entities.</p>\n<p>On 13 February 2024 at approximately 07:30 PT, an unusual pattern of policy changes triggered a latent issue where compilation optimizations did not work as intended, resulting in increased resource consumption, eventually leading to resource exhaustion. The diversion of resources away from useful work caused an increasing number of compilations to accumulate in the queue and consume resources, further exacerbating the latency.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to the issue via internal alerting on 13 February 2024 at 14:27 PT and immediately started an investigation. Engineers rolled back recent binary changes for the compilation process as a potential mitigation on 14 February 2024 at 15:35 PT, however this did not improve latency.</p>\n<p>Engineers continued to attempt further mitigation steps throughout the day on 15 February 2024, including pausing non-essential processing. Once the cause of the issue was identified at 20:23 PT, engineers put in place temporary measures to increase available memory for compilation while keeping non-essential processing paused, and tuned parameters that drive compilation optimizations. These temporary mitigations allowed compilation processing to begin to recover.</p>\n<p>Compilation processing returned to pre-outage levels by 16 February 2024, at 11:00 PT.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have fixed the underlying issue that caused compilation optimizations to not work as intended as of 21 February 2024.</li>\n<li>Introduce additional optimizations to improve compilation queue processing to better handle scenarios where a large number of changes affect the same set of entities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>Between 13 February 2024 at 07:30 PT and 16 February 2024 at 11:00 PT, Google Workspace policy updates initiated by customer admins via Admin Console would have experienced delays in propagation.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Gmail</p>",

Upon investigation, we found a misconfigured observability metric which inadvertently pulled in data from a newly provisioned test environment. All failures being reported were traced back to this test environment. We confirmed that there was no real customer impact to GitHub Packages during this incident. We have since reconfigured our observability metrics to accurately report based on environment.\nFeb 26, 21:20 UTC\nUpdate - We are seeing some recovery in NPM and GitHub Container Registry functionality, but are maintaining red status until we are certain issues won‚Äôt recur.\nFeb 26, 21:03 UTC\nUpdate - NPM and GitHub Container Registry services are degraded, particularly the upload functionality.

          "description": "Jan 31, 14:57 UTC\nResolved - This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.\nThe change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.\nFor example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.\nWe have so far identified three remediation items here:\n- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.\n- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.\n- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.\nJan 31, 14:56 UTC\nUpdate - We have resolved the issue and confirmed all regions are now operating as expected.\nJan 31, 14:49 UTC\nUpdate - The fix for ip allow lists is currently rolling out; and we are awaiting confirmation from specific geographic regions.\nJan 31, 14:33 UTC\nUpdate - We are rolling out a fix to resolve the issues with IP allow lists. This should be resolved shortly.\nJan 31, 14:14 UTC\nUpdate - Some customers are experiencing issues with IP allow lists.\nJan 31, 14:14 UTC\nInvestigating - We are currently investigating this issue.",
