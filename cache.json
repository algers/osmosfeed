          "description": "Description: We resolved an information disclosure vulnerability in the\nhello.ts.net service.\nWhat happened?\nOn January 15 2024, we became aware of a potential information disclosure\nvulnerability in the hello.ts.net service, which could show the identity of a\ndifferent Tailscale user when loaded. The hello.ts.net service receives\nidentity information and public keys of nodes tied to their IP address. On\nNovember 28 2023, we made a change to how IPs are assigned to\nTailscale nodes, making them globally non-unique. When the Tailscale service\nassigned the same IP to multiple nodes, hello.ts.net would receive identity\ninformation for one of the nodes at random. We confirmed on January 26 2024\nthat, if one of the other nodes with that IP loaded hello.ts.net, they would\nsee another user's name, email, and hostname.\nThe Tailscale Security Team immediately took hello.ts.net offline while the\nfix was in progress. The issue has been fixed and the hello.ts.net service\nwas restored on January 29 2024.\nWho was affected?\nThe incident was isolated to 10 users across 9 tailnets who could have had\ntheir information leaked to other Tailscale users. We notified the tailnet\nsecurity contacts directly in accordance with our obligations under applicable\ndata privacy laws. Due to the random nature of the vulnerability, we cannot\nconfirm that all of those users were indeed affected.\nRegular shared nodes always see unique node IPs and were not\nvulnerable in a manner similar to hello.ts.net.\nWhat was the impact?\nA small number of users had their name, email, and hostname potentially exposed\nto other Tailscale users that had nodes sharing the same IP.\nIn addition, the hello.ts.net service was offline between January 26-29\n2024. Several users reported being negatively impacted by this.\nWhat do I need to do?\nNo action is needed at this time.\nIf you have a dependency on hello.ts.net as a probing target for Tailscale\nconnectivity, consider using a different probing\nmechanism.",

The actual failover is estimated to take less than 3 seconds.\nExisting infrastructure, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, should continue running without issue. There is no network disruption to existing services expected as part of this maintenance. However, there are dependencies on multiple services. During the failover, there may be customer impacts that should be brief and transitory. The following actions may experience increased latency or failure rates during the maintenance period:\n- API calls to the DigitalOcean public API \n- Events for Droplets and Droplet-based services such as create, delete, power on/off, resize, etc \n- Control operations through the DigitalOcean Cloud Control Panel \nMultiple teams will be engaged to keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate any impact that does occur. We’ll post updates here for any unexpected changes to this scheduled maintenance, as well as progress updates during the maintenance itself.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.",

          "description": "Jan 31, 14:57 UTC\nResolved - This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.\nThe change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.\nFor example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.\nWe have so far identified three remediation items here:\n- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.\n- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.\n- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.\nJan 31, 14:56 UTC\nUpdate - We have resolved the issue and confirmed all regions are now operating as expected.\nJan 31, 14:49 UTC\nUpdate - The fix for ip allow lists is currently rolling out; and we are awaiting confirmation from specific geographic regions.\nJan 31, 14:33 UTC\nUpdate - We are rolling out a fix to resolve the issues with IP allow lists. This should be resolved shortly.\nJan 31, 14:14 UTC\nUpdate - Some customers are experiencing issues with IP allow lists.\nJan 31, 14:14 UTC\nInvestigating - We are currently investigating this issue.",

This incident impacted, at peak time 6% of the requests for viewing Avatars. Requests that were impacted did not prevent the users from continuing to use any GitHub services. This was due to an issue with the Avatars service connecting to a database host.\n We mitigated the incident by restarting the malfunctioning hosts that were not able to return the user avatar images.\n We are working to improve alerting and monitoring of our services to reduce our time to detection and mitigation.\nJan 28, 14:27 UTC\nUpdate - We have mitigated all customer impact. We are no longer serving fallback avatar icons when loading web pages for some customers. We continue to monitor the results.\nJan 28, 13:57 UTC\nUpdate - A fix has been implemented for customers seeing the default avatar (octocat) when loading web pages and we are monitoring the results.\nJan 28, 13:20 UTC\nUpdate - Some requests for getting the Avatars are returning the fallback response instead of the asked avatar since they are having issues connecting to the Mysql host\nJan 28, 13:20 UTC\nInvestigating - We are currently investigating this issue.",

Customers encountered issues creating and resuming Codespaces in multiple regions due to operational issues with compute and storage resources.\nAround 25% of customers were impacted, primarily in East US and West Europe. We re-routed traffic for Codespace creations to less impacted regions, but existing Codespaces in these regions may have been unable to resume during the incident.\nBy 7:30 UTC, we had recovered connectivity to all regions except West Europe, which had an extended recovery time due to increased load in that particular region. The incident was resolved on 2024-01-21 at 9:34 UTC once Codespace creations and resumes were working normally in all regions.\n…",

The errors were initially limited to a single region and we were able to route around the issue by transparently failing over to other regions. However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.\nDuring the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.\nWe’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.\nJan 21, 05:54 UTC\nUpdate - We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.\nJan 21, 05:26 UTC\nUpdate - We have mitigated the issues impacting Actions Larger Runners. We are still experiencing delays starting normal jobs, and are continuing to investigate.\nJan 21, 04:53 UTC\nUpdate - The team has identified the cause of the issues with Actions Larger Runners and has begun mitigation.\nJan 21, 04:16 UTC\nUpdate - The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time and a percentage of jobs failing.

This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in c…",
