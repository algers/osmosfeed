(the \"dot\" at the end may be required depending on your domain).\n(example for your main domain: www.yourwebsite.com)\nYou can also add an addon domain without using www if you want your website to be reachable this way, (example: yourwebsite.com).\nIn order to do that, you can configure an A record (Aname) in your DNS zone pointing to one of the following IP addresses:\n13.248.140.34\n\n\n76.223.14.214\n\n\nThese are the new addresses that are replacing the previous address: (52.210.201.133)\nImportant note, If you are using 52.210.201.133, you need to change to one of the new IP address as we will not be able to keep supporting this one on March 29th 2023.\nIf you need assistance doing this change, please contact our support team and we will be happy to assist you with the modifications. Please make sure to have access to your registrar (Gandi, OVH, Godaddy…) so we can assist you in performing this change. \nThe details are also available on our manual.\nThanks,",

When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\nWho is affected?\n9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\nWe have notified affected organizations where we have security contacts.\nWhat is the impact?\nTailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:\nThe destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;\nTailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and\nA non-interactive SSH session was used.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions in the admin console.\nTo update the local ports tree in advance of what’s available upstream, you can:\ncd /usr/ports/security/tailscale\nedit the Makefile to set PORTVERSION to 1.38.2\nmake makesum\nmake install\nTailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Ryan Belgrave for reporting this issue.",

As a result, the list of available languages changed per-session. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent deployment. The issue was fully mitigated once a rollback completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>Normally all languages the customer is entitled to use should appear in the list of languages (whether available or not). Workspace support admins would occasionally not see their preferred language listed at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional details:</strong></p>\n<p>As the language list appeared to change on reload, Workspace support admins could re-attempt by refreshing the support chat and would see a different list. This workaround was not confirmed to work.</p>\n<hr>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Workspace Support</p>",
