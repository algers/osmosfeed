Users are typically routed to the nearest geographic region, but may be routed to other regions when the nearest region is unhealthy.\nBeginning at 2023-10-25 09:13 UTC, Copilot began experiencing outages of individual regions, lasting 12 minutes per region. These outages were due to the nodes hosting the completion model getting unhealthy due to a recent upgrade. There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors. The outages were partial and varied across the different regions.\nIn order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we are focusing on improving our global load balancing of completion traffic during regional failures, in addition to determining and preventing the root cause of these outages.\nOct 25, 21:37 UTC\nUpdate - The observed Copilot API error rate is around 5% of the requests. As a result, some of the Copilot code suggestions are skipped or not delivered on time.\nOct 25, 21:19 UTC\nUpdate - We are seeing an impact in the US region as well.
