This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.\nWho is affected?\nAll Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.\nWhat should I do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\nWhat is the impact?\nAn attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.\nReviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Emily Trau and Jamie McClymont (CyberCX) for reporting this issue.

This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.\nWho is affected?\nAll Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.\nWhat should I do?\nUpgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\nWhat is the impact?\nAn attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.\nAn attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.\nThere is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Emily Trau and Jamie McClymont (CyberCX) for reporting this issue.

Clicking the “Next” button would not return any response, and would cause a workflow to remain in its unpublished state. A new code change had been deployed that caused us to exit early in workflow creation and this is now fixed.",

Upon investigation, we discovered that an error had occurred with the jumbomoji (a message with just an emoji) previewer during the process of a backend code-change we were performing related to emoji. Once we learned this, we were able to deploy a fix which rectified this issue for all affected users.",
