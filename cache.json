          "description": "<p> Incident began at <strong>2023-06-02 19:25</strong> and ended at <strong>2023-06-03 11:57</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class=\"cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text\"><h1>Incident Report</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>From Friday, 2 June 2023 to Saturday, 3 June 2023, some Google Workspace Administrators experienced issues performing List, Create, Update, or Delete operations for users and organizational units (OU) when using the Admin Console or Directory APIs. The total outage duration was 16 hours and 32 minutes. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The Google Workspace Admin Console and Directory APIs use a backend service to authorize requests to create/update/delete/read user and OU resources. A workflow synchronizes user and OU resources to that backend authorization service.</p>\n<p>On Friday, 2 June 2023 at 12:25 PDT, engineers rolled out a configuration change that inadvertently caused the workflow to stop synchronizing resources to the authorization service. Because the authorization service was not aware of the new resources (those created during the outage), it was unable to authorize requests and returned a 403 Unauthorized error. The incorrect configuration went undetected before being deployed to production because the automatic pre-submit checks had been suppressed because engineers incorrectly believed the change was safe.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case on 2 June 2023 at 19:33 PDT and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified that the roll out of the configuration change aligned with the start of 403 Unauthorized errors and initiated a rollback on 3 June 2023 at 00:14 PDT. The rollback completed at 00:57 PDT, mitigating the issue for new users and OU resources created after that time. Engineers performed a backfill to synchronize the impacted users and OU resources that were created after the start of the issue, fully mitigating the issue at 04:57 PDT.</p>\n<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will be updating the pre-submit checks for workflow configuration changes to better identify potential issues before rolling out to production.</li>\n<li>We will be adding a requirement to have a designated reviewer approve workflow configuration changes to ensure that automated presubmit checks are being run before rolling out to production.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>From 2 June 2023 at 12:25 PDT to 3 June 2023 at 04:57, Google Workspace Administrators may have experienced 403 Unauthorized errors when attempting to perform actions for user and OU resources via Admin Console or Directory APIs. This issue affected Create, Fetch, Update, Delete and other related operations for user and OU resources created between 2 June 2023 at 12:25 PDT and 3 June 2023 at 00:57 PDT.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Admin Console</p>",
