A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.\nWhat happened?\nMicrosoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware.

Newer versions are not affected by this problem.\nCreate an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.\nUpdate Microsoft Defender.",

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nNov  3, 20:58 UTC\nMonitoring - As of 19:55 UTC, our Engineering team has confirmed that a fix has been implemented by our upstream carrier to mitigate the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. \nWe are closely monitoring the situation and will update as soon as we have more information from the provider.\nNov  3, 19:43 UTC\nIdentified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. Upstream congestion with a network provider between Los Angeles and Dallas is impacting traffic traversing out of our SFO datacentres.\nA case has been opened by our team with the provider. Our team has attempted to shift traffic to improve the situation, but unfortunately, we continue to see approximately 10% of customer traffic impacted by this issue.\nOur team is working on an option to shift to an alternate provider if this issue is not able to be resolved by the provider in a timely manner. We will share another update once we have further information from the provider or we have an update from our Engineering team.\nNov  3, 19:27 UTC\nInvestigating - As of 17:40 UTC, our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting networking in the SFO regions. During this time, a subset of users may experience packet loss/latency and timeouts with Droplet based services in these regions, including Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Managed Database.

During the incident, approximately 9% of pull requests (less than the 20% first reported) experienced staleness of up to 7m. The root cause was identified to be an increase in the latency of a downstream dependency causing pull request workers to saturate their available capacity, resulting in delayed updates to PRs - no data was lost during this incident.\n\tWe mitigated this by adding additional capacity to the affected worker pool at 15:02 UTC. This allowed our background jobs to catch up with the backlog of updates and provide relief to our customers. Additionally, we have significantly increased the performance of the downstream service to prevent recurrence\nOct  9, 14:52 UTC\nUpdate - We are investigating delays for commits showing up on Pull Requests page loads in the web UI.

Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.\nWe had recently created a dedicated worker pool for pro…",
