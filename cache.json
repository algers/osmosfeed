Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.\nWhy the changes?\nUp until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings > Payments > Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.\nBoth options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.\nWh…",

          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device\nreauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to\nlose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.\nWhat happened?\nThe logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an\nalready-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the\ndevice’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s\nidentity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without\nany tags.\nThe bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on\n2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.\nWho is affected?\n189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either\ndirectly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast\nuser switching to switch between multiple\ntailnets.\nWe have notified affected organizations where we have security\ncontacts.\nWhat is the impact?\nDevices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the\ndevice’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,\nor the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the\ndevice. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab\nof the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this\ncould change the device’s network permissions.\nWe have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of\ndeliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect\noutcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIf you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were\ncontacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the\nadmin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix\nto the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected\norganizations.",

To our Google Meet Hardware customers who were affected we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The device requires a healthy network state and a fully initialized Meet application in order to launch. When the affected devices started up after a reboot, certain conditions caused a network check to fail. Under these circumstances, the device displayed a “Waiting for application window” message indefinitely. Devices that were automatically upgraded to the next version of ChromeOS  were more susceptible to these conditions.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were able to identify a fix and deploy to the beta fleet of production on 21 April 2023 at 07:24 US/Pacific (within 24 hours of reproducing the issue). Google engineers instructed affected customers, who wanted to expedite receiving the fix, to move their devices to the Beta release channel. The incident was mitigated after the fix was released to the stable channel on 25 April 2023 at 07:38 US/Pacific.</p>\n<p>We apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future, by completing the following actions :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix the underlying issue in the application launcher to prevent it from getting in a stuck state\nImprove logging, monitoring, and alerting for the fleet so that issues can be identified quickly</li>\n<li>Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>Beginning from 17 April 2023 at 12:04 US/Pacific, multiple customers of Google Meet Hardware devices, with Operating System (OS) versions greater than 14816.84.1 but lower than 14816.84.35, began to encounter issues in device startup following the upgrade.</p>\n<p>At its peak, Google engineers were able to identify that around ~5000 devices had stopped, which caused the admins to receive an “offline device” alert for each of those devices.</p>\n<p>These devices were frozen with “Waiting for application window” and would eventually go to sleep if left idle. The devices needed to be rebooted manually (sometimes with mitigation steps involving disconnecting the ethernet cable) or waiting for the device to reboot during a maintenance window.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Meet</p>",

Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. \n\r\n\r\nThe issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. \n\r\n\r\nOur team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience while we worked through this.
