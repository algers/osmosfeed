This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.\nWho is affected?\nAll Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.\nWhat should I do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\nWhat is the impact?\nAn attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.\nReviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Emily Trau and Jamie McClymont (CyberCX) for reporting this issue.

Once the root cause was identified, Google pushed out an update to the App Store on 4 November 2022. We believe most users (66%) updated their app by 7 November 2022. To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The database version for our Google Meet backend infrastructure uses a specific library to complete the database operations to register or reregister a Duo calling account. An issue with the error-handling mechanism in the library resulted in the backend operations not functioning as intended. This caused affected users to be unable to register or reregister phone numbers, preventing the use of calling features, on the Meet iOS app.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to the situation on 10 October 2022 at 15:18 and immediately started an investigation. Engineers reviewed the Google Meet for iOS app‚Äôs feedback logs and identified the root cause as related to registration workflow. Code improvements were identified to handle the app error seen when a user tries to register their account. The fix was deployed in a new version of the iOS app, which was rolled out to the App Store by 4 November 2022. At least 66% of users upgraded to the new version by 7 November 2022.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy additional client logging to Meet to report registration-related issues, so we can respond in a timely manner.</li>\n<li>Deploy additional monitoring for registration errors reported by the client to more quickly alert us if these types of events happen in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.</p>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>From 10 October 2022 at 15:18 to 7 November 2022 at 08:20, Google Meet iOS app users may have encountered an ‚Äúunable to add calling‚Äù error when trying to register or reregister their Duo calling account, which resulted in phone numbers not registering as intended.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Meet</p>",

We discovered the issue was related to a recent change which accidentally severed access to a number of endpoints. A network change was made and most services started to auto-recover and work again. \n\r\n\r\nDuring the restore process some users experienced search errors or slow responses within the search bar. This was resolved on November 24, 2022 at 5:58pm PST, restoring functionality for all affected users.",
