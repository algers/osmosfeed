This preventedSupport agents from being able to update or make changes to some Support cases. Additionally, the send email to customers action was unavailable for some Support cases. Some customers may have seen an error when updating cases from the customer portal. As a workaround, customers and Support agents could successfully update their cases by retrying the action. The issue was mitigated at 17:27 US/Pacific and service was fully restored for both the Support agents and customers. The total duration of the service disruption was 7 hours and 4 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>ROOT CAUSE:</strong></p>\n<p>Cloud Support Systems experienced a large backlog of case field update actions pending in the SLO timed actions queue. These timed actions were running in large batches, with updates running in the queue every few minutes. This caused the cases to be locked down from any other update actions while that job was running.</p>\n<p>This backlog was caused by the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There was an increase in the limit of cases being processed every hour by the SLO time queue job.</li>\n<li>There was a rollback issue with the 3rd party product while processing time based tasks which caused multiple processing requests of the same tasks.</li>\n<li>There was a configuration in the case trigger which created a backlog on large batches which triggered the above bug with the 3rd party product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:</strong></p>\n<p>Our engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal support agent&#39;s case on Monday, 12 September 2022. Engineering began investigating and working on a solution. On Tuesday, September 13 there was one report of external impact. The issue progressed and impact became visible externally on Friday, 16 September 2022 at 10:23 US/Pacific, and the row lock issue was confirmed to have widespread external impact. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers filed a case with the 3rd party product support to address the issue with Cloud Systems. The  backlog actions were purged manually using the 3rd party setup UI which brought the backlog in the queue down by 80%, the issue was completely resolved for the end user on Friday, 16 September at 17:27 US/Pacific.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a code enhancement with the 3rd party vendor to confirm the error handling code which triggered the issue is fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Workspace Support</p>",
