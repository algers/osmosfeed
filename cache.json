A small percentage of customers may have also experienced errors or slowness when loading channels, sending messages, accessing admin pages, and connecting to Slack.\n\r\n\r\nAn issue with a routine database cluster migration inadvertently caused a decrease in capacity. Unfortunately, this coincided with a scheduled job to process a large number of custom status requests, an activity that commonly occurs at the top of each hour. The number of incoming requests exceeded the unintentionally reduced capacity of the database cluster, leading to errors and sluggishness for some actions in Slack. As these requests piled up, other Slack services began to experience issues as well, including a small number of users being unable to connect.\n\r\n\r\nWe paused the scheduled custom status job to immediately mitigate the load on the affected database cluster. This resolved some of the errors affecting Slack services. Once we established we had sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled job, we resumed processing the custom status requests, fully restoring normal service for all affected users.\n\r\n\r\nOnce the load was balanced and custom status processing had returned to normal, we deployed a fix to correct the issue with the database cluster migration, bringing capacity back to the expected level.",
