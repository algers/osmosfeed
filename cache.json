          "description": "<p> Incident began at <strong>2024-02-26 09:42</strong> and ended at <strong>2024-02-26 21:02</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class=\"cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text\"><h1>Incident Report</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>On Monday, 26 February 2024 at 1:42 US/Pacific, Google Apps Script experienced a higher rate of failures while attempting various operational actions for a duration of 11 hours, 20 minutes. Apps Script integrations in Google Workspace products, such as those that integrate with Google Calendar and Google Docs, were partially unavailable. This includes 3rd party Google Workspace add-ons that were built using Apps Script. During the incident, the issue was intermittent for most users with overall error rates of up to 25% for the listed services, and customers retrying actions were eventually successful.</p>\n<p>This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform‚Äôs performance and availability.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>A third-party Google Workspace Add-on with a large pre-existing install base added a dependency on Google Apps Script, which triggered a significant increase in load for the Apps Script service. Due to this high QPS, latencies increased, followed by an increase in error rates. All server threads supporting Apps Script integrations were busy processing requests, causing our servers to start rejecting requests and resulting in errors. Ultimately this resulted in temporary service interruption for users who rely on Apps Script functionality within their Google Workspace environments.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineering was alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on Monday 26 February 2024 at 00:16 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineering identified the problematic deployment, rolled back the change, and temporarily blocked access to the add-on so the service could fulfill requests as expected. This resulted in a significant error rate decrease, services became available, and the issue was fully recovered on Monday 26 February, 2024 13:02 US/Pacific.</p>\n<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding additional system limits to prevent a single Apps Script project from creating overload scenarios</li>\n<li>Improving the process for blocking problematic Apps Script projects</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>\n<p>On Monday, 26 February 2024 from 01:42 to 13:02 US/Pacific customers utilizing products with Apps Script integrations may have experienced the following:</p>\n<h3>Apps Script</h3>\n<p>Apps Script encountered errors during the creation or loading of scripts.</p>\n<h3>Google Calendar</h3>\n<p>A subset of customers encountered failures while listing the third-party conferencing solutions. Additionally, failures were observed while attaching a conference to an event with the Google Calendar.</p>\n<h3>Google Forms, Google sheets and Google docs</h3>\n<p>Custom functions and Add-ons created with Apps Script would have experienced disruptions when used in Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Google Calendar</p>",

Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.\nWe have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.\n\nFeb 29, 12:21 UTC\nUpdate - We're seeing recovery and are going to take time to verify that all systems are back in a working state.\nFeb 29, 12:19 UTC\nUpdate - Issues is operating normally.\nFeb 29, 12:18 UTC\nUpdate - Webhooks is operating normally.\nFeb 29, 11:05 UTC\nUpdate - We're continuing to investigate delayed background jobs.

We reverted this code change. However, rolling back reintroduced a separate issue that we'd resolved earlier in the day. \r\n\r\nWe prepared a tailored revert to roll back the code causing the workflow problem while also including the fix for the previous issue.
