Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.\nWhy the changes?\nUp until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings > Payments > Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.\nBoth options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.\nWh…",

          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device\nreauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to\nlose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.\nWhat happened?\nThe logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an\nalready-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the\ndevice’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s\nidentity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without\nany tags.\nThe bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on\n2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.\nWho is affected?\n189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either\ndirectly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast\nuser switching to switch between multiple\ntailnets.\nWe have notified affected organizations where we have security\ncontacts.\nWhat is the impact?\nDevices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the\ndevice’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,\nor the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the\ndevice. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab\nof the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this\ncould change the device’s network permissions.\nWe have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of\ndeliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect\noutcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIf you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were\ncontacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the\nadmin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix\nto the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected\norganizations.",

          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed tailnets created by GitHub organizations which were subsequently renamed to be associated with a new GitHub organization with the previous name.\nWhat happened?\nTailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.\nWho is affected?\nUp to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name.

Some users were unable to sign in and, if already signed in, experienced an error for the duration of this incident.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The root cause has been identified as a misconfiguration in a recent Android Classroom release which caused the Android app to point to a backend staging environment instead of production. This resulted in elevated traffic and task failures, ultimately causing Android app availability issues.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>On Tuesday 18 April at 17:32 US/Pacific, Google engineers were alerted to an issue via internal monitoring impacting Google Classroom Android users and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers identified that the latest Classroom Android Version (Version Name: 8.0.141.20.90.2, Version Code: 213051414) release contained a backend misconfiguration which resulted in the Android Classroom application availability issues, causing an estimated ~2.5% of users to experience sign in issues and error messages if already signed in. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the misconfigured release and updating a fix release, this fully resolved the issue for all users Friday, 21 April at 07:58 US/Pacific.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement Classroom specific alerting mechanism to capture staging and production anomalies.</li>\n<li>Optimize and improve manual and automated testing validation for release components.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Classroom</p>",
