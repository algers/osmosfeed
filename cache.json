We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users. To see the fix applied, user impacted users should press Command/Control + R. We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.",

This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. \n\r\n\r\nWe are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future.
