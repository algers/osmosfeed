Some customers may have also had trouble with loading channels, adding users to group direct messages, API hyperlink rendering, and missing Saved items.\n\r\n\r\nA mass de-provisioning event inadvertently increased load across our infrastructure, causing issues with Threads for many users. \n\r\n\r\nAs an immediate mitigation strategy, we temporarily deactivated the Threads view for all users. \n\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we ended the long running de-provisioning jobs, and significantly scaled up the systems that handle those jobs. We also made several code changes to reduce the effect a de-provisioning job of this scale would have on our infrastructure, and redistributed some of the load across other parts of the system. \n\r\n\r\nThe optimisation and redistribution work brought error rates down, which resolved most of the issues with channel loading, group direct messages, hyperlinks, and Saved items that users were experiencing. \n\r\n\r\nAt this point, we made the call not to re-enable the Threads view in order to give our recovery efforts more time to restore balance to the system. \n\r\n\r\nOnce the load was appropriately balanced across our infrastructure, and we were able to confirm that our up-scaling systems were prepared to handle any future spikes, we re-enabled the Threads view for all users.",
