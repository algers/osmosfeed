Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.\nWhy the changes?\nUp until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings > Payments > Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.\nBoth options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.\nWh…",

          "description": "Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed tailnets created by GitHub organizations which were subsequently renamed to be associated with a new GitHub organization with the previous name.\nWhat happened?\nTailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.\nWho is affected?\nUp to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name.

When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\nWho is affected?\n9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\nWe have notified affected organizations where we have security contacts.\nWhat is the impact?\nTailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:\nThe destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;\nTailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and\nA non-interactive SSH session was used.\nWhat do I need to do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions in the admin console.\nTo update the local ports tree in advance of what’s available upstream, you can:\ncd /usr/ports/security/tailscale\nedit the Makefile to set PORTVERSION to 1.38.2\nmake makesum\nmake install\nTailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.\nCredits\nWe would like to thank Ryan Belgrave for reporting this issue.",

That number was removed from our 2FA pool, and services have resumed as usual.
