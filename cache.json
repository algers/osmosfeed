This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platformâ€™s performance and availability.</p>\n<h2>Root Cause</h2>\n<p>The root cause is due to a combination of unexpected increased traffic and an inefficient code in the policy fetch that created excessive objects. The device management server was unable to handle requests from client devices as the compute usage spiked above its limit. This ultimately impacted all requests, as the device management server was triggered to auto reject requests.</p>\n<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>\n<p>Google engineers were internally alerted to the ChromeOS outage on 25 August at 08:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers quickly identified an increase in usage on the device management servers and took steps to remove the blockage that was causing requests to be rejected, this mitigated the issue and allowed traffic to return to normal and for successful requests to process on 25 August  at 11:40 US/Pacific.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimize the current capacity limit alerting to detect excessive usage quicker</li>\n</ul>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: ChromeOS</p>",

This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.\nDuring this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data.
