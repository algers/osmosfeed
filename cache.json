          "description": "<p> Incident began at <strong>2022-09-07 16:04</strong> and ended at <strong>2022-09-08 06:29</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class=\"cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text\"><h1>Incident Report</h1>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>On 07 September 2022, Google Workspace experienced an issue where the existing and new users, who had Gmail recently enabled for them, between 09:04 US/Pacific and 19:11 US/Pacific had a delay before they were able to access Gmail. To our Workspace customers whose users were impacted, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.</p>\n<p><strong>Root Cause:</strong></p>\n<p>Workspace uses a roster management and indexing API to easily manage, view users, and manage Access Control List (ACL) based on a list of users. When there is a change in a group membership of a user, the API will send a notification. The notification is then compiled by the compilation engine and the output of the compilation is sent to a backend setting service which is used by different Workspace apps to determine whether an app is enabled for a given user and to provide users with appropriate access to the app.</p>\n<p>A recent rollout to the roster management backend database inadvertently introduced an issue which generated unnecessary notification traffic on user computation. When membership changes are made to a large roster, all of its descendants need to be recomputed, generating a lot of backend notifications that need to be recomputed and updated. The trigger for the issue was a membership change request from a large customer which required compilation of a large number of user changes.</p>\n<p>This caused rapid compilation of app settings for the same customer in a very short time interval putting excessive load on database partitions holding the relevant data thus creating a hotspot. The hotspotting caused delays in compilation of user settings across Workspace applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Remediation and Prevention:</strong></p>\n<p>Google engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 07 September 2022 at 09:37 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 11:57 US/Pacific, engineers identified the hotspotting issue and narrowed down the trigger. At 13:05 US/Pacific, engineers began mitigating the hotspotting by manual intervention. By 13:59, the compilation success rate had improved and started processing the backlog. The backlog gradually progressed and completed for all the affected customers at 19:11 US/Pacific resolving the issue.</p>\n<p>Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent a future recurrence by taking the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhance the compilation scheduling design for better fairness and isolation of customer requests.</li>\n<li>Enhance debugging tools so that on-call engineers can quickly identify the issues from compilation logs.</li>\n<li>Complete rollout to fix the issue with the roster management backend database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Detailed Description of Impact:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gmail:</strong>\nGoogle Workspace users, including newly created users that had Gmail newly enabled for them, between 09:04 US/Pacific and 19:11 US/Pacific on 7 September 2022 experienced a delay before they were able to access Gmail.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Workspace apps:</strong>\nUsers may have experienced delays in accessing other Workspace apps after those apps were enabled for them. Our analysis did not reveal any noticeable errors for other Workspace apps.</p>\n</div><hr><p>Affected products: Gmail</p>",

We have pushed a fix for this problem by reinstating the mechanism to ensure this only occurs for users once.",

This occurred when a group of database servers became overloaded and failed.\n\r\n\r\nWe first reduced the load on our infrastructure manually. The issue was then resolved when our automated processes kicked in, replacing the damaged server with a healthy one. While the issue is resolved, we will continue to investigate the root cause to avoid these problems in the future.",
