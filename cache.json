In some cases this can\ndegrade NAT traversal and may cause some connections to route through DERP.\nThis may increase node-to-node latency and decrease throughput. Version 1.48.1\nresolves the issue and re-enables port mapping via UPnP.\nWhat happened?\nTailscale nodes use UPnP as one of the mechanisms to open UDP port forwarding\nin routers to help with NAT traversal.
