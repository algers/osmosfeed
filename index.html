Identified - We&#x27;re currently experiencing an issue that appears only in certain unique circumstances when a running scenario is not properly using the values of team or organization variables during executions.
Specific circumstances for the issue are:
- A team or organization variable is used as a filter condition OR there is more than one team or organization variable referenced within a single mapped field, OR the variable is used inside a function.
- AND the scenario was created / modified before March 8, 2023 
- AND the execution occurs after May 3, 2023
Workaround: 
Any user encountering this issue can open the affected scenario, make any change (move a module) and hit save. This will immediately resolve the issue for that scenario.
Complete resolution: 
The development team is actively working on a fix that will address any scenario where the issue still persists. Will post an update once we have more information around the permanent fix.
Jun  6, 09:09 CEST
Investigating - We&#x27;re currently experiencing issues with Scenarios that use Custom Variables. Our engineering team is investigating the root cause.</span>

Mini Incident Report
We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.
(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 2 June 2023 at 12:25
Incident End: 3 June 2023 at 04:57
Duration: 16 hours, 32 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Google Workspace Admin Console
Regions/Zones: Global
Description:
Some Google Workspace Administrators experienced issues performing List, Create, Update, or Delete operations for users and organizational units when using the Admin Console or Directory APIs. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a configuration change that prevented resources (new or changes to existing resources) from synchronizing with a backend system used for authorizing requests. This resulted in 403 errors for attempted changes to these resources. The total outage duration was 16 hours and 32 minutes.  Google will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.
Customer Impact:
Some Google Workspace Administrators experienced 403 Forbidden errors when performing List, Create, Update, or Delete operations for users and organizational units via the Admin Console or Directory APIs. The issue only affected resources created after Friday, 2 June 2023 at 12:25.
Additional details:
Engineers rolled back the configuration change to prevent additional resources from being impacted on Saturday, 3 June  2023 at 00:45. At 04:57,  engineers fully mitigated impact to all resources by backfilling their data to the backend system.

On June 02, 2023 from 3:28 PM PDT to around 5:29 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced large empty spaces in the Workflow Builder UI and issues with publishing/adding or editing steps in a workflow. 


We traced the issue to a recent code change which caused the channel selector to appear out of view, resulting in the inability to take certain actions while editing a workflow. 


We reverted the change which solved the issue for all customers.</span>

From May 19, 2023 at 12:00 AM PDT until May 25, 2023 at 8:00 AM PDT, some users may have experienced issues triggering shortcut workflows.


We carried out our investigation and determined that cached data on the back end temporarily broke legacy workflows. In the process of determining our path to a resolution the issue resolved itself. We are taking the necessary steps to prevent similar issues in the future.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jun  1, 01:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 31, 23:11 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-06-01 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-06-01 05:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO2 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

We traced the source of the issue back to an error that occurred in our autocomplete cache. A fix was rolled out to our search logic which began to show the correct results.


Users can refresh their Slack client (by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R) if they are still experiencing issues. We apologize for any interruption.</span>

From May 30th, 2023 at around 8:00 PM PDT until May 31st, 2023 at 9:20 AM PDT, users with the Reacji Channeler app installed in their workspace experienced some issues where the app would not execute.


The issue was traced back to a recent change that occurred for one of our app databases. This caused the app to accept new requests even though it was unable to connect to the database, resulting in timeout errors. 


We reverted the change and restarted the backend processes which allowed the app to connect to the database again, resolving the issue for impacted users. We apologize for any disruptions to your day.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has continued to actively monitor the situation resulting from multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. Over the last few days, our team has continued to make routing changes where possible. 
Crews have been able to complete some cable repairs and we expect to see our network routing stabilize once the repair of a few more cables are completed in the coming weeks. Until then, we expect to see intermittent periods of packet loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and New York City, as well as Singapore and Toronto. These are normally short-lived and happen during Singapore business hours when traffic is heavy. 
Given the relative stability of routes, we will now close out this incident and provide any needed updates sepa…</span>

Our investigation uncovered that a recent code change we made had caused an overwhelming impact on our databases. We rolled this change back and temporarily redirected user traffic as our databases recovered. Once we rolled back the change and our databases were in a healthier state, the issue became resolved for impacted users.


We will continue to implement new ways to detect issues like this early-on.

On May 23, 2023 from 5:30 PM PDT to around 8:15 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced blank profile pictures, display names, channel names, and emoji in Slack.


A code change inadvertently altered the firewall rules for some of our regional servers, preventing the Slack clients connected to these regions from loading profile and channel elements as expected.


As an immediate mitigation step, we stopped the code change from rolling out any further, and pushed all traffic from the affected servers to other regions. This resolved the issue for impacted customers. 


We then reverted the code change and manually restored the correct firewall rules on the affected servers. Once the correct rules were back in place, we reintroduced traffic to these regions, fully resolving the issue.</span>

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. This will be the final phase of the three maintenance activities performed by our team in AMS3 on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On May 18, 2023 from 12:50 PM PDT to May 22, 2023 07:35 AM PDT, some users found that channel reminders containing emojis couldn&#x27;t be sent. 


We determined that a recent change in code added a property that was invalid in the reminder creation schema, which caused reminders to be rejected upon sending.


Once we reverted the change, the issue was resolved for affected users.</span>

We investigated, and determined that a local Internet service provider (ISP) is not resolving Slack domains as expected. 


If you&#x27;re having trouble connecting to Slack, please reach out to your ISP for assistance.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 23, 16:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 23, 15:20 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-23 16:00 UTC
End: 2023-05-23 20:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. This will be the second of three maintenance activities performed by our team in AMS3 on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Resolved - We have identified and fixed an issue related to missing PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE standard fee that occurred between 07:41 AM PDT May 17th until 10:17 AM PDT May 23rd 2023. 
The issue caused standard fee PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE to be cleared and as a result some reservations might be missing the cleaning fee. 
Please reapply the Standard Fees by making PUT pricing_settings requests with the desired fees.
This should re-populate the listings&#x27; Standard Fees array as intended, namely the PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE.
If you have any further queries related to this incident, please submit a ticket via the Partner Support Portal and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From 12:24 - 13:26 UTC, we experienced an issue that impacted our DNS API services. During this time, customer deployments to App Platform will have failed to process, and managing domains and DNS records through both the Cloud Control Panel and API would have been unavailable. 
If you continue to experience problems with either of these services please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel. Thank you for your patience.
May 20, 13:57 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team identified that the root cause of the issues impacting App Platform deployments was a wider issue involving our DNS API. Along with the App Platform deployment errors, customers would have experienced trouble viewing and editing domains and their DNS records through both the Cloud Control Panel and the API. 
A fix has been rolled out and as of 13:26 UTC customers should no longer be experiencing any issues involving the services listed above. Our team will continue to monitor the situation to ensure stability and provide a final update as soon as we confirm the issue has been fully resolved. 
Thank you for your patience.
May 20, 12:46 UTC
Investigating - As of 12:24 UTC, Our Engineering team is investigating a global issue with our App Platform service. During this time, users may experience issues while performing any operations for new, updated and deleting deployments. 
At this time, previously deployed running Apps are not impacted. We will provide an update as soon as possible.</span>

                              <span>Our engineering team deployed a minor technical change to the handling of cryptographic operations, such as API token validation.

During this redirection we saw a higher than anticipated volume of failed API requests which resulted in an impact to the Slack service. As a result, Slack was down between 1:56 PM PDT - 2:03 PM PDT.

This was resolved when these changes were rolled back by infrastructure teams.</span>

Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-16 22:00 UTC
End: 2023-05-17 02:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the NYC2 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
