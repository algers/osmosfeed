On March 3rd, 2023 from 9:03 AM PST to 9:13 AM PST, some users had trouble logging into Slack, sending messages and completing API requests.


The cause of this issue was in relation to a planned exercise where we removed traffic from an isolated location to simulate failure of a single data center. In our investigation, we discovered that one database experienced an issue causing the exercise to fail. We were able to quickly identify the failure and apply a manual fix which resolved the issue. We determined less than 1% of our customers were affected.</span>

From February 22nd, 2023 at 2:00 PM until February 24th, 2023 2:16 PM PST, some users experienced issues loading audio files on iOS.


We discovered that the server was returning an unexpected code in response to requests for audio files, causing the app to only partially load the content. We made a change to ensure the server returned the correct response code, resolving the issue for all affected customers.

On Tuesday February 14th, 2023 from 1:19 AM PST to 3:50 AM PST some customers reported an issue where the API method files.upload created a new message instead of uploading files in a thread.


Our team identified that the cause of the issue was linked to a recent update. This change was rolled back which fixed the issue.

On Monday February 13th, 2023 at 07:00PM to Tuesday February 14th, 2023 at 01:02 AM PST, customers were unable to view threads in public channels they had not joined. This was caused by a recent code change - we&#x27;ve deployed a correction to this and the issue is now resolved.

Resolved - Engineering has implemented mitigations, which should have resolved performance issues. We’ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we run into issues again.
We found that page analytics events, such as page views and page edits, did not save during the time of this incident. Impacted users may see their page related analytics as undercounted for February 13, 2023. Our team is looking into how we can prevent this from happening in the future. We appreciate your patience while we work on making these improvements.

Sounds impossible to find a guest message in seconds ? 
As we keep improving our features, we work closely with property users and managers like yourself to learn how we can help you run your business more efficiently. 
After several workshops, reflections, and feedback, our Smily team did several adjustments to help you use our centralized Inbox in order to simplify this daily communication.
We added several filters to help you find the conversations easily in the Inbox, you can now filter by the following criterias:
Conversation status
Assignee
Guest
Booking stage
Booking status
Rental
Booking tag
Rental tag

This way you can find the exact conversation you are looking for in a matter of seconds :) 
For more details please see the article from our manual
Wishing you all a pleasant day!</span>
