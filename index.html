Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed that creation, forking, and restoration of PostgreSQL clusters on v16 is functioning correctly.
Upgrades for lower-versioned PostgreSQL clusters to v16 remain unavailable at this time and users will see errors if they attempt to perform that upgrade. Our Engineering team continues to work on making upgrades to v16 available again, but we expect this to take some time.
If you continue to experience issues or have any questions, please open a ticket with our support team.
Feb 28, 20:56 UTC
Monitoring - After testing, teams have determined that PostgreSQL v16 is safe for new creations, as well as forks and restores for existing clusters. At this time, v16 is re-enabled in our Cloud Control Panel and users creating, forking, or re…</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of the issue with networking in our SFO2 region. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. Thank you for your patience throughout this incident!
Feb 28, 22:23 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has confirmed that the faulty network hardware component was the cause of this issue. From 21:39 - 22:11 UTC, this component was not functioning correctly, causing networking issues for a subset of customers in our SFO2 region, as well as internal alerts in our SFO1/SFO3 regions. 
At this time, all services should now be operating normally. We will monitor this incident for a short period of time to confirm full resolution.
Feb 28, 22:17 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue with networking in our SFO regions to be related to an issue with a network hardware component in SFO2. They have isolated that component and we&#x27;re observing error rates returning to pre-incident levels at this time. 
We are continuing to look into this failure, but users should be seeing recovery on their services. We&#x27;ll provide another update soon.
Feb 28, 22:06 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is currently investigating internal alerts and customer reports for an increase in networking errors in our SFO regions for Droplets and Droplet-based services. We will provide an update as soon as we have further information.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
Between 13 February 2024 at 07:30 PT and 16 February 2024 at 11:00 PT, multiple Google Workspace products experienced propagation delays for enterprise customer policy changes for a duration of 3 days, 3 hours, and 30 minutes.
To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
Google Workspace products expose settings through the Admin Console that Customer Admins can group together to create policies that govern how their users interact with Workspace products and services.
When a Customer Admin makes changes to policy settings in Admin Console, those changes are processed by a compilation server, which computes effective settings for the applicable entities. This process includes optimizations to avoid the repeated processing of multiple changes that affect the same set of entities.
On 13 February 2024 at approximately 07:30 PT, an unusual pattern of policy changes triggered a latent issue where compilation optimizations did not work as intended, resulting in increased resource consumption, eventually leading to resource exhaustion. The diversion of resources away from useful work caused an increasing number of compilations to accumulate in the queue and consume resources, further exacerbating the latency.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to the issue via internal alerting on 13 February 2024 at 14:27 PT and immediately started an investigation. Engineers rolled back recent binary changes for the compilation process as a potential mitigation on 14 February 2024 at 15:35 PT, however this did not improve latency.
Engineers continued to attempt further mitigation steps throughout the day on 15 February 2024, including pausing non-essential processing. Once the cause of the issue was identified at 20:23 PT, engineers put in place temporary measures to increase available memory for compilation while keeping non-essential processing paused, and tuned parameters that drive compilation optimizations. These temporary mitigations allowed compilation processing to begin to recover.
Compilation processing returned to pre-outage levels by 16 February 2024, at 11:00 PT.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
We have fixed the underlying issue that caused compilation optimizations to not work as intended as of 21 February 2024.
Introduce additional optimizations to improve compilation queue processing to better handle scenarios where a large number of changes affect the same set of entities.
Detailed Description of Impact
Between 13 February 2024 at 07:30 PT and 16 February 2024 at 11:00 PT, Google Workspace policy updates initiated by customer admins via Admin Console would have experienced delays in propagation.

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to core networking infrastructure, to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. 
Expected impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience increased latency or a brief disruption in network traffic. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

On February 26, 2024, from 9:21 AM PST to 9:16 AM PST on February 27, some users encountered the close button disappearing in the right pane where threads and profiles are viewed.

We discovered this was caused by a missing check in the change workspace process that prevented the right pane elements from rendering properly. Once the cause was identified, a change was made to the logic for drawing Slack&#x27;s interface when switching workspaces. Once the change was rolled out, the issue was resolved.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:
On February 26, 2024 from 9:00 AM PST to 9:36 AM PST, some users experienced problems sending and loading messages in Slack. Others may have completed these actions successfully but more slowly than expected.

Earlier today, we deployed a routine update to part of our network infrastructure. During this work, we deprovisioned some of our proxy servers and provisioned a new set. Some of our webapp servers took longer than expected to sync with the new list of proxy servers, resulting in a spike in connection errors. This coincided with the regular 9:00 AM PST increase in traffic to our servers, which may have exacerbated impact.

By around 9:36 AM PST, error rates had decreased and user impact had completely subsided, most likely due to our automatic scaling functionality. However, we&#x27;re continuing to analyze data from this event to fully understand the root cause and prevent similar issues in the future.</span>

Scheduled - Hello,
Please note there is scheduled infrastructure maintenance on 26.02.2024, between 6:00-8:00 AM CET, when you can expect a slower scenario processing. Specifically, scenarios using a datastore module might see reduced performance which can cause its longer execution.
We will inform you once the maintenance is completed.
Thank you very much for understanding.
Kind regards,
Make team</span>

Resolved - On Monday, February 26th, from 20:45 UTC to 21:39 UTC, GitHub Packages reported an outage indicating a degradation in GitHub Container Registry and NPM package upload functionality. Upon investigation, we found a misconfigured observability metric which inadvertently pulled in data from a newly provisioned test environment. All failures being reported were traced back to this test environment. We confirmed that there was no real customer impact to GitHub Packages during this incident. We have since reconfigured our observability metrics to accurately report based on environment.
Feb 26, 21:20 UTC
Update - We are seeing some recovery in NPM and GitHub Container Registry functionality, but are maintaining red status until we are certain issues won’t recur.
Feb 26, 21:03 UTC
Update - NPM and GitHub Container Registry services are degraded, particularly the upload functionality. Investigation is underway.
Feb 26, 21:01 UTC

Resolved - On February 26, 2024, between 18:34 UTC and 19:37 UTC our background job service was degraded and caused job start delays up to 15 minutes. Users experienced delays in Webhooks, Actions, and some UI updates (e.g. a delay in UI updates on pull requests). This was due to capacity problems with our job queueing service, and a failure of our automated failover system.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over to our secondary cluster.   No data was lost - recovery began at 18:55 UTC, when the backlog of enqueued jobs began to process.
We are actively working to repair our failover automation and expand the capacity of our background job queuing service to prevent issues like this in the future.

                              <span>Issue Summary:

From 2:58 PM PST on February 22, 2024, until 9:47 PM PST on February 25, 2024, some users were unable to access their workspace billing history.

We traced the issue to a recent backend code change and reverted the change, which fixed the issue for all affected users.

Thank you very much for your patience while we resolved this.</span>

Are you connected to VRBO OTA?
Starting today at 2pm UTC, we will be fetching guest reviews and ratings from VRBO, and you&#x27;ll be able to respond to them directly from Smily interface :)
🚧 Pain Points Addressed:
No need to visit VRBO to check and respond to guest reviews.
Previously, you couldn&#x27;t rate a guest.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Manage all your reviews in one place.
Easily read and respond to VRBO guest reviews from our Review section on the Smily interface.
Rate guests with ease.
ℹ️ Information and next steps:
We will fetch all your past reviews.


You will be able to rate all past bookings matching those criteria:
--&gt; Bookings without guest review that ended in the last 365 days;
--&gt; Bookings for which a guest review is already present and 14 days haven’t passed since the guest made the review;


Make use of this new feature and ensure to leave reviews for guests. This is an important criterion for VRBO and will impact your property ranking.


Lastly, you can use our &quot;automated reviews&quot; feature, released at the end of last year, for VRBO reviews too.


Have a great review day,
Your Smily team :)</span>

We carried out a thorough investigation and observed trends, but found no evidence of an issue on our side. By around 2:59 PM PDT, error rates had already subsided and we received confirmation from several users that they could load Threads again by reloading Slack.

Whilst no remedial action was taken on our end, we&#x27;re analyzing data from this event to understand ways to mitigate similar issues that may occur in the future.

We&#x27;re confident that there will be no further impact to users.</span>

Between 1:18 AM PST on February 21, 2024, and 5:35 AM PST on February 22, 2024, some users experienced issues resetting their passwords, especially when trying to set up two-factor authentication. 

We traced the issue to a recent backend code change and reverted the change, which fixed the issue for all affected users. 

Thank you for your patience while we resolved this and we apologize for any disruption to your work day.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the resolution of the issue impacting the Container Registry in multiple regions. 
Everything involving the Container Registry should now be functioning normally. 
We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team for further review.
Feb 21, 18:03 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has identified an internal operation within the Container Registry service which was placing load on the service, leading to latency and errors. The team has paused that operation in order to resolve the issue impacting the Container Registry in multiple regions. Users should not be facing any latency issues while interacting with their Container registries and also while building their Apps. 
We are actively monitoring the situation to ensure stability and will provide an update once the incident has been fully resolved. 
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Feb 21, 15:41 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with the DigitalOcean Container Registry service. Beginning around 20:00 UTC on February 20, there has been an uptick in 401 errors for image pulls from the Container Registry service.
During this time, a subset of customers may experience latency or see 401 errors while interacting with Container Registries. This issue also impacts App Platform builds and users may encounter delays while building their Apps or experience timeout errors in builds as a result. Users utilizing Container Registry for images for deployment to Managed Kubernetes clusters may also see latency or failures to deploy.
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - On Wednesday February 21, 2024, 17:07 UTC, we deployed a configuration change to one of our services inside of Actions. At 17:14 UTC we noticed an increase in exceptions that impacted approximately 85% of runs at that time. 
At 17:18 UTC, we reverted the deployment and our service immediately recovered. During this timeframe, customers may have noticed their workflows failed to trigger or workflows were queued but did not progress.
To prevent this issue in the future we are improving our deployment observability tooling to detect errors earlier in the deployment pipeline.
Feb 21, 17:20 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

Hello,
During the above window, we will be performing maintenance in our BLR1 region as part of a firewall migration.
Expected impact:
As part of this maintenance, event processing in BLR1 will be disabled for a period of up to 15 minutes during the three-hour window. During this period, users won&#x27;t be able to create, destroy, or modify new or existing DO services in BLR1 (such as Droplets, DBaaS/DOKS clusters, etc.).
If you have any questions related to this issue, please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket

                              <span>Issue summary:

Starting around 12:46 PM PST on February 6, 2024, until around 4:06 PM PST on February 9, 2024, some users experienced issues with their profile pictures loading, resulting in the default avatar image displaying instead of their custom image.

We identified a bug that caused missing image data from a database cache. We fixed the bug and reset the backend cache to pull new data, which initially fixed the issue around 4:00 PM PST on February 6. However, some users began experiencing the problem again once their Slack client refreshed.

We continued investigating the issue, tracing it back to a piece of code that would push older image data to a database that housed profile information, and promptly reverted the incorrect code which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

We are thrilled to share with you some great news :)
We are now supporting and managing Booking.com Sponsored Benefit program at Smily;
Benefits for you:
You were facing the obstacle where booking.com **was paying a small amount of the booking.com reservation due to a discount offered to the guest.
1/ it was not blocking the synchronisation of your listing but was creating an issue for the payment;
2/ you had to send manually a payment link to collect the remaining amount to the guests. This won’t be necessary anymore!


Now, as we do support the Sponsored benefit program, you will still see and receive this small amount in advance paid by Booking.com and we will process with success the rest of the payment!


You can now join this program if you were waiting for this functionality 🙂
How does this program benefit your business?
When applied, it offers the following advantages for your business:
Boosts bookings from price-conscious customers
Lowers cancellations with customers paying in advance
Increases your revenue by covering the reduced amount to drive more bookings
Take the next step:
Take a look at what this program is about and check out if you are eligible to enable it and enjoy it;

Your business deserves the best, and with Smily’s latest feature, we’re here to ensure you get just that.</span>

                              <span>New!
  
The Airbnb Listing expectation type feature is now available on Smily. 
This update lets you enrich your listings with additional information, directly from Smily&#x27;s user-friendly interface.
Pain Points Addressed:
Gone are the days of toggling between platforms. Previously, you had to navigate Airbnb&#x27;s website to update listing details, a time-consuming and inefficient process. Smily&#x27;s new feature streamlines this, offering a seamless integration within the interface.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Easily accessible under the &quot;amenities&quot; section in the Smily interface, the new &quot;Property Info&quot; category empowers you to select and customize expectation types, with an optional description of up to 100 characters.
This information is then flawlessly synced with Airbnb for those using full synchronization, ensuring a cohesive and accurate listing.
It will also be synchronised on your website if you have one with Smily!
Such information is key and valuable for the guests to avoid any negative surprises on check-in day!
→ Here is where to find this new section on the Smily interface👇
-&gt; Then click on the pen to edit/add an optional description;

ℹ️ Next steps and important information
For those using this via Airbnb, we&#x27;ve already fetched your existing listing expectations from Airbnb as of February 9th.


To ensure data alignment with this new feature, please update any changes made since then before our official release on February 21st via the Smily interface;
→ On February 21st, we will start the synchronisation of your data from Smily to the Airbnb application. Any values not reflected on the Smily interface will be removed from Airbnb.


Please note, that the Smily interface allows a description limit of 100 characters compared to Airbnb&#x27;s 300. Should this affect your listings, we&#x27;ll reach out individually.
→ if you cannot update your description before February 21st, let us know please;


Have a great day,
Your Smily team :)</span>

On February 12, 2024 from 6:00 AM PST to 8:32 AM PST, some users experienced latency when loading canvases or errors related to editing and saving canvases.

Upon investigation we determined that this was caused by rate limits put in place by an upstream provider. We restarted the impacted endpoints to mitigate the issue immediately, which resolved the issue for all affected users. We&#x27;re continuing to partner with our upstream provider to reduce the likelihood of this occurring in the future.</span>

Resolved - On Monday February 12th, 2024, 03:00 UTC we deployed a code change to a component of Copilot. At 06:00 UTC we observed an increase in timeouts for code completions impacting 55% of Copilot users at peak across Asia and Europe.
At 12:00 UTC we restarted the nodes, and response durations returned to normal operation until 13:00 UTC when response durations degraded again. At 16:15 UTC we made a configuration change to send traffic to regions that were not exhibiting the errors, which resulted in code completions working fully although completing at a higher latency than normal for some users. At 18:00 UTC we reverted the deploy and response durations returned to normal.

Resolved - On February 9, 2024 between 10:34 UTC and 11:24 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded and 63% of webhooks were delayed by up to 16 minutes with an average delay of 5 minutes. No webhook deliveries were lost. This was due to an issue with an overloaded backend data store that was unable to process network requests fast enough.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over traffic to healthy hosts.
We are expanding the capacity of the backing store as well as making the Webhooks service more resilient to this kind of issue. 

Feb  9, 11:25 UTC
Update - Webhooks is operating normally.
Feb  9, 11:11 UTC
Update - We are investigating latency in processing webhooks. Customers may see a delay of around 5 minutes at this time. We will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.
Feb  9, 11:09 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Webhooks</span>

If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team. 
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Feb  7, 19:41 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has fully deployed the fix for the issue with Droplet resizes and is now monitoring the situation. Users can now retry Droplet resizes and should see them succeed.
We&#x27;ll post another update once we confirm the fix resolves this incident.
Feb  7, 15:49 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue with failed Droplet resizes and a fix is in the process of being deployed. 
Users attempting to resize Droplets where the image for the Droplet has been deleted or retired (e.g. a user created a Droplet from a Snapshot, but later deleted that Snapshot) will see failures. All other resizes are succeeding normally.
We&#x27;ll post another update once the fix has completed deployment.
Feb  7, 15:32 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an uptick in failed Droplet resizes, beginning Feb 6, 20:57 UTC. 
During this time, some users may experience failures when attempting to resize Droplets, in all regions. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
Feb  7, 08:55 PST
Monitoring - Our Async Request Processing system had an issue this morning, which resulted in increased delays between the time a request was enqueued and when it was processed, and may have resulted in an elevated processing failure rate. This began around 8:10 AM PST, and was resolved by 9:15 AM PST.
We are still actively monitoring, but are not expecting any ongoing issues at this time.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Feb  6, 17:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Feb  2, 20:23 UTC
Scheduled - Start Time: 17:00 UTC Feb 6, 2024
End Time: 00:00 UTC Feb 7, 2024
During the above time, our Engineering Team will be performing maintenance to failover some internal databases from one cluster to another.
Extensive testing has been conducted to ensure this maintenance will be successful and result in minimal impact to DigitalOcean users. The actual failover is estimated to take less than 3 seconds.
Existing infrastructure, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, should continue running without issue. There is no network disruption to existing services expected as part of this maintenance. However, there are dependencies on multiple services. During the failover, there may be customer impacts that should be brief and transitory. The following actions may experience increased latency or failure rates during the maintenance period:
- API calls to the DigitalOcean public API 
- Events for Droplets and Droplet-based services such as create, delete, power on/off, resize, etc 
- Control operations through the DigitalOcean Cloud Control Panel 
Multiple teams will be engaged to keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate any impact that does occur. We’ll post updates here for any unexpected changes to this scheduled maintenance, as well as progress updates during the maintenance itself.

Resolved - Between 3:00 UTC - 14:22 UTC, some users may have experienced database automation failures or delays in actions being triggered.
This is now resolved, and the affected automations have completed. Database automation services are now running as normal. 
Thank you for your patience while we worked through this issue.
Feb  5, 05:30 PST
Monitoring - Notion&#x27;s database automation service began experiencing problems at approximately 3 AM UTC today, which caused a number of automation actions to fail or experience delays. 
Our engineers have identified a fix, and are now retrying automations that failed to trigger during this period. 
We will continue to monitor the situation and share an update when this is fully resolved.</span>

Resolved - On 2024-02-05, from 09:26 to 13:20 UTC some GitHub customers experienced errors when trying to download raw files. An overloaded server exposed a bug, causing us to return HTTP 500 error codes.
The issue was mitigated by disabling the server and re-routing traffic. We are implementing improvements to our routing logic to more quickly avoid troublesome hosts in the future.

On February 1, 2024 between 12:57 AM PST and 3:52 AM PST, some users in Germany were having trouble receiving two-factor authentication codes via SMS.

This was caused by an issue with a service provider and has now been resolved.

Users in Germany should no longer be having trouble and may also choose to use an authentication app to receive their 2FA codes instead of SMS.

Resolved - An update to our design system caused issues loading dynamic content in the global side navigation menu and in other page-specific sidebar navigation elements. Impacted users saw continuous loading spinners in place of dynamic menu content. User impact lasted from 0:55 UTC to 4:41 UTC on February 1st.
We are working on a number of improvements in response to this incident. We are adding request volume monitors to sidebar navigation endpoints and making changes to our front end escalation paths to improve our time to detect and time to recovery for incidents of this nature. We have also begun work to improve both automated and manual testing for these types of changes in order to prevent recurrence.
Feb  1, 04:41 UTC
Update - This issue has been resolved. A reload of your browser window/tab may be required if you continue to experience issues with the collapsable navigation sidebars not loading.

Resolved - This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.
The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.
For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn&#x27;t developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.
We have so far identified three remediation items here:
- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.
- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.
- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.
Jan 31, 14:56 UTC
Update - We have resolved the issue and confirmed all regions are now operating as expected.
Jan 31, 14:49 UTC
Update - The fix for ip allow lists is currently rolling out; and we are awaiting confirmation from specific geographic regions.
Jan 31, 14:33 UTC
Update - We are rolling out a fix to resolve the issues with IP allow lists. This should be resolved shortly.
Jan 31, 14:14 UTC
Update - Some customers are experiencing issues with IP allow lists.

                              <span>Issue summary:
From 11:37 AM PST to 11:48 AM PST on January 24, 2024, we experienced an unexpected amount of API calls to our servers that occurred within a short window of time. The volume of API calls resulted in some users experiencing latency loading channels and general difficulties connecting to Slack. We investigated the impact with a broad lens and began to observe signs of recovery around 12:09 PM PST.

During this time, we cautiously observed our health metrics to ensure our servers were accurately recovering. As a result of our thorough monitoring, there was a delay before we could confirm the issue was fully resolved. Our teams have also put in measures to help reduce the likelihood of this occurring again in the future.</span>
