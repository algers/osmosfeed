💡What is KeyNest Points?
KeyNest Points is a global network of over 5,500 locations where you can securely store and exchange keys with ease. No more hassles of on-site visits or high installation costs.
Most KeyNest Points are open 24/7, ensuring flexibility for key exchanges at your convenience. Discover your nearest Point and its opening hours on the interactive map provided.

 


🏠 KeyNest Points - Your Trusted Partners
These points are typically local businesses such as convenience stores, cafes, hotels, or petrol stations, conveniently situated near your properties.
Each KeyNest Point is managed by trained staff, ensuring instant and secure key exchanges. Your peace of mind is paramount.

🔤 How Does it Work?

Here&#x27;s a quick overview of how KeyNest Points operate:
Drop your keys at a local KeyNest Point.
Your keys are tagged and logged into the system for real-time tracking.
Staff at the Point securely stores your keys.
Send the location of the key and the code to your guests within your automated Smily messages.
Guests or cleaners visit the Point, show their safety code, and receive the key.
Upon return, they drop the key back at the same Point, and you are notified.

                              <span>Issue summary:

From 11:26 AM PST on January 12, 2024 to 10:04 AM PST on January 15, 2024, some users were unable to configure 2FA on their accounts. We were made aware of this after a spike in reports early in the morning of Monday, January 15.


Upon investigation, this issue was traced back to a recent code change which we discovered was preventing users from being redirected back to the 2FA configuration page after entering their password during the 2FA setup process. We immediately reverted this change which fully resolved the issue.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From approximately 20:15 - 21:45 UTC, DigitalOcean experienced a global networking issue that impacted multiple services and products. Users saw increased error rates and latency for event processing, accessing our Cloud Control Panel/API, applying Cloud Firewall policies, accessing www.digitalocean.com and our Community site, and DNS resolution. Additionally, users saw timeouts/increased latency for networking requests to Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as connections to existing App Platform Apps. 
We sincerely apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience issues or have questions, please reach out to our Support team by opening a ticket from within your account. …</span>

Improvement
  
We&#x27;re thrilled to share a new feature we’ve just released for booking.com properties.
What&#x27;s New?
The rate rule Booking at least &#x27;x&#x27; day ahead is now synchronised on booking.com channel;
Why Does This Matter?
You were facing the obstacle where Guests were making a booking for the same day or &#x27;x&#x27; days (based on your settings) even though the setting to prevent that was activated;
-&gt; It won’t happen anymore.
What&#x27;s Next?
If you face any obstacle with this setting, reach out to us; 
 
Improvement
  
We are and will be working on more improvements to make your day-to-day easier :)

Resolved - On January 9 between 12:45 and 13:56 UTC, services in one of our three sites experienced elevated latency for connections.  This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in c…</span>

                              <span>Description: On Windows before Tailscale version 1.52 and on Linux before
Tailscale 1.54, the tailscale serve and tailscale funnel features allowed
users to serve the contents of directories that their user account could not
access, but which the tailscaled service process could.
What happened?
A user could escalate their own file read access by running, for example,
tailscale.exe serve http / C:\, and then browsing to the local HTTP endpoint.
The issue can also occur on Linux if the local administrator enabled an operator
user ID with tailscale up --operator&#x3D;$USER, as the $USER account could
serve itself files that it could not normally read.
Who is affected?
Owners of Windows deployments for which the users of Tailscale nodes do not also
have OS-level administrative access, and owners of Linux deployments where the
administrator enabled non-root --operator access.
This issue can only be triggered by a local user and cannot be triggered
remotely.
What is the impact?
This issue enables local privilege escalation (file read access). Access to
certain system files (such as /etc/shadow on Linux) can then be used to obtain
full administrative control over the host.
What do I need to do?
On Windows 10 and later, upgrade to Tailscale 1.52 (released 30 October
2023) or later, which resolves the issue.
On Windows 7 and 8, upgrade to Tailscale 1.44.3 (released 8 Jan
2024), which resolves the issue.
On Linux, upgrade to 1.54 (released 15 November 2023) or later,
which resolves the issue.
The best practice is to run the latest stable version, which as of this writing
is 1.56.1. Consider turning on automatic updates.
Use Tailscale ACLs to control the availability of Funnel.</span>

Resolved - On December 26, 2023, GitHub received a report through our Bug Bounty Program demonstrating a vulnerability which, if exploited, allowed access to credentials within a production container. We fixed this vulnerability on GitHub.com the same day and began rotating all potentially exposed credentials. Through this process we found some flaws in how we rotate certain credentials and are working on improving our credential rotation process.
