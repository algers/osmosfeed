Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From approximately 20:15 - 21:45 UTC, DigitalOcean experienced a global networking issue that impacted multiple services and products. Users saw increased error rates and latency for event processing, accessing our Cloud Control Panel/API, applying Cloud Firewall policies, accessing www.digitalocean.com and our Community site, and DNS resolution. Additionally, users saw timeouts/increased latency for networking requests to Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as connections to existing App Platform Apps. 
We sincerely apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience issues or have questions, please reach out to our Support team by opening a ticket from within your account. â€¦</span>

Improvement
Â Â 
We&#x27;re thrilled to share a new feature weâ€™ve just released for booking.com properties.
What&#x27;s New?
The rate rule Booking at least &#x27;x&#x27; day ahead is now synchronised on booking.com channel;
Why Does This Matter?
You were facing the obstacle where Guests were making a booking for the same day or &#x27;x&#x27; days (based on your settings) even though the setting to prevent that was activated;
-&gt; It wonâ€™t happen anymore.
What&#x27;s Next?
If you face any obstacle with this setting, reach out to us; 
Â 
Improvement
Â Â 
We are and will be working on more improvements to make your day-to-day easier :)

Resolved - On January 9 between 12:45 and 13:56 UTC, services in one of our three sites experienced elevated latency for connections. This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend. First, those requests that eventually timed out were starving out other requests from executing, leading to broader failed requests.  Second, the git backend services are critical dependencies of many GitHub features, which led to broader impact to other jobs and requests. An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period. We are actively working to identify all contributing factors of this incident, including opportunities to improve resiliency across all impactâ€¦</span>

                              <span>Description: On Windows before Tailscale version 1.52 and on Linux before
Tailscale 1.54, the tailscale serve and tailscale funnel features allowed
users to serve the contents of directories that their user account could not
access, but which the tailscaled service process could.
What happened?
A user could escalate their own file read access by running, for example,
tailscale.exe serve http / C:\, and then browsing to the local HTTP endpoint.
The issue can also occur on Linux if the local administrator enabled an operator
user ID with tailscale up --operator&#x3D;$USER, as the $USER account could
serve itself files that it could not normally read.
Who is affected?
Owners of Windows deployments for which the users of Tailscale nodes do not also
have OS-level administrative access, and owners of Linux deployments where the
administrator enabled non-root --operator access.
This issue can only be triggered by a local user and cannot be triggered
remotely.
What is the impact?
This issue enables local privilege escalation (file read access). Access to
certain system files (such as /etc/shadow on Linux) can then be used to obtain
full administrative control over the host.
What do I need to do?
On Windows 10 and later, upgrade to Tailscale 1.52 (released 30 October
2023) or later, which resolves the issue.
On Windows 7 and 8, upgrade to Tailscale 1.44.3 (released 8 Jan
2024), which resolves the issue.
On Linux, upgrade to 1.54 (released 15 November 2023) or later,
which resolves the issue.
The best practice is to run the latest stable version, which as of this writing

                              <span>Issue summary:

From 1:43 PM PST on December 19, 2023 to 10:25 AM PST on December 20, 2023, a small number of users experienced seeing blurred file previews. We discovered that this affected users with international data residency enabled in their workspace.


A change was made to our file storage, resulting in unexpected behaviour with file previews. We promptly identified the problematic code and reverted back the change in an effort to prevent file previews from becoming blurred. 

We later ran a script to fix affected files to display with clear previews, resolving the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - At 2023-12-18 20:03 UTC, our monitoring flagged an increase in GitRPC response errors that resulted from a change that was made that caused backend replicas to temporarily become out of sync while the change was deployed. During this time, approximately 2,500 users across 8,200 repos would have seen the merge button disabled or received failures from the merge API endpoint.
Upon discovering the failures, our engineers assessed that the shortest path to resolution was to roll forward and manually deploy to the remaining hosts, which resolved the issue at 2023-12-18 21:26.
Dec 18, 21:26 UTC
Update - Git Operations is operating normally.
Dec 18, 21:19 UTC
Update - We&#x27;re seeing issues related to Pull Requests impacting a small number of users. We are aware deploying a fix and expect to resolve within the next 60 minutes.

Incident Report
Summary
On 07 December 2023, various Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers experienced intermittent authentication issues when routed to one of our data centers in the US East region. As a result, a limited number of users could not sign-up, login, or re-authenticate for a duration of 1 hour and 32 minutes.
To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers who were impacted during this issue, we sincerely apologize â€“ this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.
Root Cause
Googleâ€™s authentication stack is broad and deep, running across every region and zone to provide functionality globally across all Google products. This particular issue was scoped to a single microservice&#x27;s serving jobs within a single data center; this microservice handles serving some of the user-facing pages involved in sign-up, login, and re-authentication flows.
To improve resource usage efficiency, engineers had been implementing more advanced autoscaling algorithms across these serving jobs globally. These changes were rolled out gradually over a period of several weeks without any issues.
On 7 December, the rollout kicked off rolling restarts across the individual tasks within the serving jobs in a single data center in the US East region. Due to internal network routing at the time, this data center was serving traffic from the US East area as well as South America. These factors placed additional demand on each task&#x27;s thread pool, both overloading some tasks and affecting those tasks&#x27; ability to report metrics back to load-balancers. This caused requests to be intermittently dropped between the load-balancer and the individual serving tasks; these dropped requests led to user-facing 500 error pages.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted by our internal monitoring system on 07 December at 11:16 US/Pacific and immediately started investigating the issue. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers worked to confirm that traffic could be safely re-routed away from the impacted serving jobs as a mitigation strategy. Traffic was rerouted to other data centers, and the customer impact was mitigated by 12:32 US/Pacific. Our engineers then reviewed and tuned the stability and performance of both this and related serving jobs globally before declaring the incident fully resolved.
Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business. We are committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and are completing the following actions:
Enhance metrics and dashboards to make these complex load-balancing dynamics more legible to engineers, reducing the time to mitigate similar future issues.
Improve performance-testing of resource-allocation profiles for each individual serving job
Detailed Description of Impact
Google Workspace:
During the issue, a limited number Google Workspace users served from this data center had issues with log-in and sign-up for part of unauthenticated traffic, including some users going through &quot;Sign in with Google &#x27;&#x27; interactive flows using their Google Workspace account
Multiple Google Workspace product log-in attempts, reauthentication attempts, and some new account creation requests from users routed to this data center failed with error 502s.
Users that were already logged in were not affected by the issue.
Google OAuth:
Some users served from this data center intermittently experienced error 502s when attempting to &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; and encountering interactive sign-in or re-authentication flows.
Google Cloud Console:
A limited number of  users served from this data center experienced error 502s intermittently when attempting to log-in to the Cloud Console.
