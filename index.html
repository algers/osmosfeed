Update - All payments with a check date of March 10th have been successfully submitted. Some have been completed, and others will complete between Saturday, March 11th and Monday, March 13th.
This morning, Rippling was assured by SVB that all payments would be processed today. However, when SVB fell into receivership with the FDIC, we immediately began working with JPMorgan Chase to find an alternative means to send funds to employees. 
As a result of the actions we took, all employees will receive their payments between today and Monday morning, depending on which bank they use. Rippling has extended our own capital to fund these payments while client funds are locked up with SVB.
When will employees with a March 10, 2023 check date be paid?

On March 9, 2023 from 8:28 PM to March 10, 2023 8:40 AM PST, some users that were signed into multiple workspaces experienced a redirect issue when signing into the Google Drive app from Slack. 


After the sign-in button was clicked, the user was redirected to a different Slack workspace they were signed into, causing a 400 Bad Request response.


We made a code change to ensure the user was redirected to the proper workspace, fixing the authentication error and resolving the issue.</span>

On March 9, 2023 from 9:07 AM to 10:06 AM PST, some users experienced trouble with various features in Slack, such as adding bookmarks to channels, using workflows, connecting to Slack, or sending Slack Connect invites.


We discovered the service degradation was prompted by a load test that ran at a higher rate than intended, causing database outages to occur. To remediate the issue, we scaled back the load test to the normal rate which resolved the problem for all impacted users.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary: 

On March 7, 2023 from 9:15 AM to 6:31 PM PST, some users may have experienced slow search response times or failed searches.


We made a routine adjustment to our infrastructure that inadvertently increased load and decreased response rates for our search servers. New messages sent during this period were not indexed immediately and would not have been searchable.


We restarted the affected server nodes, returning search performance to normal and allowing the system to catch up on the backlogged indexing tasks. Once the system handled the backlog and we confirmed that indexing was complete, full search functionality was restored to all customers.


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

We will be doing some improvements on our website infrastructure which may temporarily affect your websites.
The maintenance will take place on tuesday March 14, 2023 at 06:00am CET and will have a duration of 3 hours max.
What will be the impact?
· Websites may not be unreachable for up to 10 minutes at maintenance time.
· SSL may be unavailable from the beginning of the maintenance for up to 3 hours (website will still be reachable without https)
Do I need to do anything?
This maintenance will impact the DNS zone we are using to link your website to our infrastructure, therefore some changes will be required in the 2 weeks following this update if you are using your own domain name with A records.
We will send a second communication with the information and update our manual to help you with this transition.
Of course our support team will be there to assist you.
Thank you for your comprehension,</span>

On Sunday March 5, 2023 from 4:00pm PST to March 6, 2023 1:51pm PST, some users weren&#x27;t receiving sign-in codes, or the codes were delivered to their spam folder. 


Our team determined this wasn&#x27;t an issue caused by Slack, but a third-party email provider. 


To ensure emails from Slack are successfully routed to the appropriate inbox, impacted users should add the domains @slack.com and @slack-mail.com, to their trusted senders list.</span>

On March 3rd, 2023 from 9:03 AM PST to 9:13 AM PST, some users had trouble logging into Slack, sending messages and completing API requests.


The cause of this issue was in relation to a planned exercise where we removed traffic from an isolated location to simulate failure of a single data center. In our investigation, we discovered that one database experienced an issue causing the exercise to fail. We were able to quickly identify the failure and apply a manual fix which resolved the issue. We determined less than 1% of our customers were affected.</span>

From February 22nd, 2023 at 2:00 PM until February 24th, 2023 2:16 PM PST, some users experienced issues loading audio files on iOS.


We discovered that the server was returning an unexpected code in response to requests for audio files, causing the app to only partially load the content. We made a change to ensure the server returned the correct response code, resolving the issue for all affected customers.

On Tuesday February 14th, 2023 from 1:19 AM PST to 3:50 AM PST some customers reported an issue where the API method files.upload created a new message instead of uploading files in a thread.


Our team identified that the cause of the issue was linked to a recent update. This change was rolled back which fixed the issue.

Should customers continue to experience this behaviour, a hard refresh of the Slack client will fix this.</span>
