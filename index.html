Incident Report
Summary
On 17 April 2023 at 11:43 US/Pacific, some Google Docs and Google Slides users experienced issues with actions involving images. During this time,  users creating new documents may have received ‘unavailability’ errors when attempting to upload images and ‘500’ errors when creating new documents from templates that included images.
This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer users, and we took immediate steps to remediate the issue and prevent it from happening again.
Root Cause
A recent change to a backend storage policy triggered a validation failure in the system which caused some users to receive error messages when attempting the following actions:
Creating a presentation based on a template which contains images/thumbnails
Copying a document with images to their own account
Inserting embedded images into any Editor
Remediation and Prevention
On Monday, 17 April 2023 at 11:43 US/Pacific, Google engineers were alerted to an issue by internal monitoring systems and immediately started an investigation. On 17 April 2023 at 13:54 US/Pacific, Google engineers mitigated the issue by rolling back the backend storage policy change. Users were advised that images uploaded while the issue was ongoing would remain broken and needed to be reinserted.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Optimize the validation process and add automation for validation of directory policies for Drive with Docs and Slides to prevent a recurrence.

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On April 20th, 2023 from 6:00 AM PDT until 7:45 AM PDT, a small number of users experienced latency issues when using Slack. Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. 


The issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. 


Our team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

We are happy to announce that new damage deposit payment settings are now available in your Smily account. Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.
Why the changes?
Up until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings &gt; Payments &gt; Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.
Both options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.

                              <span>Issue summary:


On April 16rd, 2023 from 12:11 PM PDT until 14:39 PM PDT, certain Android users on the Free plan reported issues with loading channels in the Android app.  


Upon investigation, this was attributed to the implementation of a data optimization feature, intended to improve app performance. We have rolled back this feature temporarily, which has corrected the observed issue.  A full investigation and remedy will take place prior to reimplementation. 


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this.  We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

On April 10, 2023 at 7:30 PM PDT, some customers began experiencing delays when uploading files. We traced the issue back to a recent update made to how some file uploads are handled. Reverting this change fixed the issue, and customers were no longer experiencing it as of April 11, 2023 at 7:33 AM PDT.

Resolved - While we still await details from Twitter the only way how to create a connection at this moment is to have every user to create their own Twitter app at developer.twitter.com and use the apps API Key and API Key Secret to create a new connection in Make. We updated our documentation with details about how to obtain API Key and API Key Secret - https://www.make.com/en/help/apps/marketing/twitter#obtaining-api-key-and-api-key-secret-values-for-your-twitter-account
Apr  3, 23:56 CEST
Update - Twitter has suspended our app. We are continuing to investigate.
Apr  3, 21:29 CEST
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jun 30, 10:55 PDT
Scheduled - As announced on July 5, 2021 we are deprecating our XML API connection.
XML listings can no longer be activated: this means that new XML listings will remain unlisted even if you set 
true
. The same is valid for existing listing that are deactivated (i.e. you will not be able to reactivate a XML listing if it gets unlisted).

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed tailnets created by GitHub organizations which were subsequently renamed to be associated with a new GitHub organization with the previous name.
What happened?
Tailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.
Who is affected?
Up to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name. Additiona…</span>

On April 3rd, 2023 from 11:00 AM PDT until 11:45 AM PDT, users on certain cellular service networks had issues receiving SMS texts for two-factor authentication (2FA). 


Upon investigation, this was traced to one unverified toll free number, which prevented 2FA codes from being approved for delivery. That number was removed from our 2FA pool, and services have resumed as usual. We are reviewing our process and alerting around outgoing phone number verification to ensure the issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.</span>

From March 31st, 2023 at 7:18 PM PDT to April 1st, 2023 at 11:30 AM PDT, some customers may not have been able to sign in to Slack with the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. 


During a routine cleanup process, we made some changes to the project behind the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. This change inadvertently prevented the Slack mobile apps from confirming the validity of customer Google accounts during login. 


We reverted this change, restoring normal login behaviour for all affected customers, and we&#x27;re working to ensure it does not happen again. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

Resolved - We have identified and resolved an internal issue that resulted in reservation webhook notifications being sent with $0 price. The incident was active between 13:40 and 14:20 PDT. Reservations payments were processed correctly, but nightly prices and fees appeared as $0 within the webhooks. Please use the GET Reservations API to retrieve the correct reservations prices. Alternatively, please contact the API Integrations team for additional help.
Apologies for the inconvenience.</span>
