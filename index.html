                              <span>Issue summary: 

On April 3rd, 2023 from 11:00 AM PDT until 11:45 AM PDT, users on certain cellular service networks had issues receiving SMS texts for two-factor authentication (2FA). 


Upon investigation, this was traced to one unverified toll free number, which prevented 2FA codes from being approved for delivery. That number was removed from our 2FA pool, and services have resumed as usual. We are reviewing our process and alerting around outgoing phone number verification to ensure the issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.</span>

From March 31st, 2023 at 7:18 PM PDT to April 1st, 2023 at 11:30 AM PDT, some customers may not have been able to sign in to Slack with the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. 


During a routine cleanup process, we made some changes to the project behind the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. This change inadvertently prevented the Slack mobile apps from confirming the validity of customer Google accounts during login. 


We reverted this change, restoring normal login behaviour for all affected customers, and we&#x27;re working to ensure it does not happen again. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
On 24 March 2023, Google Workspace Support Chat experienced issues displaying some support language options for 3 hours, 28 minutes. As a result, some customers may have been unable to choose their preferred support language when starting a chat session.
Root Cause
When Google Workspace customers choose chat support, the Support UI displays a list of languages the customer may choose from before the chat session begins.
On 24 March 2023 at 01:10 US/Pacific, engineers rolled out an update for the Support UI that migrated the language select dropdown to a new select component. This update introduced an issue where the rendering of the select component would cut off some language options when the number of available languages exceeded the select component’s container boundaries.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to the issue via an internal report on 24 March 2023 at 03:27 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified the Support UI change as the cause of the issue at 04:13 US/Pacific and started a rollback of the update at 04:16 US/Pacific. The rollback finished at 04:38 US/Pacific, resolving the issue.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Update automated testing for Support UI releases to better detect these types of potential UI issues.
Detailed Description of Impact
On 24 March 2023 from 01:10 to 04:38 US/Pacific, Google Workspace Support Chat experienced issues displaying some support language options.
Normally, all languages the customer is entitled to use should appear in the list of languages whether available or not. For the duration of this issue, Workspace support admins may have not seen their preferred language listed at all.

Resolved - We have identified and resolved an internal issue that resulted in reservation webhook notifications being sent with $0 price. The incident was active between 13:40 and 14:20 PDT. Reservations payments were processed correctly, but nightly prices and fees appeared as $0 within the webhooks. Please use the GET Reservations API to retrieve the correct reservations prices. Alternatively, please contact the API Integrations team for additional help.
Apologies for the inconvenience.</span>

On March 21, 2023 at 7:32 AM PDT to March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT, the &quot;Time when workflow started&quot; variable is missing from all steps of the Workflow Builder for new and existing workflows. If the variable was used to publish to a Google Sheet, the cell would be empty.


We discovered a bug that made date fields invisible without any errors displayed, though workflows were still running and had access to the value.


We have released a fix on March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT. Previously impacted workflows need to retrieve the timestamps from the workflow in the Workflow Builder. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out.</span>

                              <span>Reference: CVE-2023-28436
Severity: Medium
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH in FreeBSD allowed commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified by Tailscale SSH access rules.
Affected platforms: FreeBSD
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.38.2 or later
What happened?
A difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD setgroups system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.
Who is affected?
9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security contacts.
What is the impact?
Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:
The destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;
Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and
A non-interactive SSH session was used.
What do I need to do?
If you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions in the admin console.
To update the local ports tree in advance of what’s available upstream, you can:
cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale
edit the Makefile to set PORTVERSION to 1.38.2
make makesum
make install
Tailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.

As we are doing some improvements on our infrastructure, we have some modifications that are necessary on the way some of your website domains are configured.
To ensure that you have the best configuration, we invite you to review the settings on your registrar to make sure that you have the correct configuration.
What is needed?
Your main domain should be under a **Cname **record with **www **and point to dns1.happystay.com. (the &quot;dot&quot; at the end may be required depending on your domain).
(example for your main domain: www.yourwebsite.com)
You can also add an addon domain without using www if you want your website to be reachable this way, (example: yourwebsite.com).
In order to do that, you can configure an A record (Aname) in your DNS zone pointing to one of the following IP addresses:
13.248.140.34


76.223.14.214


These are the new addresses that are replacing the previous address: (52.210.201.133)
Important note, If you are using 52.210.201.133, you need to change to one of the new IP address as we will not be able to keep supporting this one on March 29th 2023.
If you need assistance doing this change, please contact our support team and we will be happy to assist you with the modifications. Please make sure to have access to your registrar (Gandi, OVH, Godaddy…) so we can assist you in performing this change. 
The details are also available on our manual.
Thanks,</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
Mar 13, 06:18 UTC
Update - We are continuing to work on a fix for this issue.
Mar 10, 23:13 UTC
Update - All payments with a check date of March 10th have been successfully submitted. Some have been completed, and others will complete between Saturday, March 11th and Monday, March 13th.
This morning, Rippling was assured by SVB that all payments would be processed today. However, when SVB fell into receivership with the FDIC, we immediately began working with JPMorgan Chase to find an alternative means to send funds to employees.

On March 9, 2023 from 8:28 PM to March 10, 2023 8:40 AM PST, some users that were signed into multiple workspaces experienced a redirect issue when signing into the Google Drive app from Slack. 


After the sign-in button was clicked, the user was redirected to a different Slack workspace they were signed into, causing a 400 Bad Request response.


We made a code change to ensure the user was redirected to the proper workspace, fixing the authentication error and resolving the issue.</span>

On March 9, 2023 from 9:07 AM to 10:06 AM PST, some users experienced trouble with various features in Slack, such as adding bookmarks to channels, using workflows, connecting to Slack, or sending Slack Connect invites.


We discovered the service degradation was prompted by a load test that ran at a higher rate than intended, causing database outages to occur. To remediate the issue, we scaled back the load test to the normal rate which resolved the problem for all impacted users.</span>

On March 7, 2023 from 9:15 AM to 6:31 PM PST, some users may have experienced slow search response times or failed searches.


We made a routine adjustment to our infrastructure that inadvertently increased load and decreased response rates for our search servers. New messages sent during this period were not indexed immediately and would not have been searchable.


We restarted the affected server nodes, returning search performance to normal and allowing the system to catch up on the backlogged indexing tasks. Once the system handled the backlog and we confirmed that indexing was complete, full search functionality was restored to all customers.


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

We will be doing some improvements on our website infrastructure which may temporarily affect your websites.
The maintenance will take place on tuesday March 14, 2023 at 06:00am CET and will have a duration of 3 hours max.
What will be the impact?
· Websites may not be unreachable for up to 10 minutes at maintenance time.
· SSL may be unavailable from the beginning of the maintenance for up to 3 hours (website will still be reachable without https)
Do I need to do anything?
This maintenance will impact the DNS zone we are using to link your website to our infrastructure, therefore some changes will be required in the 2 weeks following this update if you are using your own domain name with A records.
We will send a second communication with the information and update our manual to help you with this transition.
Of course our support team will be there to assist you.
Thank you for your comprehension,</span>

On Sunday March 5, 2023 from 4:00pm PST to March 6, 2023 1:51pm PST, some users weren&#x27;t receiving sign-in codes, or the codes were delivered to their spam folder. 


Our team determined this wasn&#x27;t an issue caused by Slack, but a third-party email provider. 


To ensure emails from Slack are successfully routed to the appropriate inbox, impacted users should add the domains @slack.com and @slack-mail.com, to their trusted senders list.</span>
