Resolved - While we still await details from Twitter the only way how to create a connection at this moment is to have every user to create their own Twitter app at developer.twitter.com and use the apps API Key and API Key Secret to create a new connection in Make. We updated our documentation with details about how to obtain API Key and API Key Secret - https://www.make.com/en/help/apps/marketing/twitter#obtaining-api-key-and-api-key-secret-values-for-your-twitter-account
Apr  3, 23:56 CEST
Update - Twitter has suspended our app. We are continuing to investigate.
Apr  3, 21:29 CEST
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

Scheduled - As announced on July 5, 2021 we are deprecating our XML API connection.
XML listings can no longer be activated: this means that new XML listings will remain unlisted even if you set 
true
. The same is valid for existing listing that are deactivated (i.e. you will not be able to reactivate a XML listing if it gets unlisted).

What happened?
Tailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.
Who is affected?
Up to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name. Additiona…</span>

On April 3rd, 2023 from 11:00 AM PDT until 11:45 AM PDT, users on certain cellular service networks had issues receiving SMS texts for two-factor authentication (2FA). 


Upon investigation, this was traced to one unverified toll free number, which prevented 2FA codes from being approved for delivery. That number was removed from our 2FA pool, and services have resumed as usual. We are reviewing our process and alerting around outgoing phone number verification to ensure the issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.</span>

During a routine cleanup process, we made some changes to the project behind the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. This change inadvertently prevented the Slack mobile apps from confirming the validity of customer Google accounts during login. 


We reverted this change, restoring normal login behaviour for all affected customers, and we&#x27;re working to ensure it does not happen again. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
On 24 March 2023, Google Workspace Support Chat experienced issues displaying some support language options for 3 hours, 28 minutes. As a result, some customers may have been unable to choose their preferred support language when starting a chat session.
Root Cause
When Google Workspace customers choose chat support, the Support UI displays a list of languages the customer may choose from before the chat session begins.
On 24 March 2023 at 01:10 US/Pacific, engineers rolled out an update for the Support UI that migrated the language select dropdown to a new select component. This update introduced an issue where the rendering of the select component would cut off some language options when the number of available languages exceeded the select component’s container boundaries.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to the issue via an internal report on 24 March 2023 at 03:27 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified the Support UI change as the cause of the issue at 04:13 US/Pacific and started a rollback of the update at 04:16 US/Pacific. The rollback finished at 04:38 US/Pacific, resolving the issue.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Update automated testing for Support UI releases to better detect these types of potential UI issues.
Detailed Description of Impact
On 24 March 2023 from 01:10 to 04:38 US/Pacific, Google Workspace Support Chat experienced issues displaying some support language options.
Normally, all languages the customer is entitled to use should appear in the list of languages whether available or not. For the duration of this issue, Workspace support admins may have not seen their preferred language listed at all.

Resolved - We have identified and resolved an internal issue that resulted in reservation webhook notifications being sent with $0 price. The incident was active between 13:40 and 14:20 PDT. Reservations payments were processed correctly, but nightly prices and fees appeared as $0 within the webhooks. Please use the GET Reservations API to retrieve the correct reservations prices. Alternatively, please contact the API Integrations team for additional help.
Apologies for the inconvenience.</span>

On March 21, 2023 at 7:32 AM PDT to March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT, the &quot;Time when workflow started&quot; variable is missing from all steps of the Workflow Builder for new and existing workflows. If the variable was used to publish to a Google Sheet, the cell would be empty.


We discovered a bug that made date fields invisible without any errors displayed, though workflows were still running and had access to the value.


We have released a fix on March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT. Previously impacted workflows need to retrieve the timestamps from the workflow in the Workflow Builder. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out.</span>

Severity: Medium
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH in FreeBSD allowed commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified by Tailscale SSH access rules.
Affected platforms: FreeBSD
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.38.2 or later
What happened?
A difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD setgroups system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.
Who is affected?
9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security contacts.
What is the impact?
Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:
The destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;
Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and
A non-interactive SSH session was used.
What do I need to do?
If you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions in the admin console.
To update the local ports tree in advance of what’s available upstream, you can:
cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale
edit the Makefile to set PORTVERSION to 1.38.2
make makesum
make install
Tailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.

As we are doing some improvements on our infrastructure, we have some modifications that are necessary on the way some of your website domains are configured.
To ensure that you have the best configuration, we invite you to review the settings on your registrar to make sure that you have the correct configuration.
What is needed?
Your main domain should be under a **Cname **record with **www **and point to dns1.happystay.com. (the &quot;dot&quot; at the end may be required depending on your domain).
(example for your main domain: www.yourwebsite.com)
You can also add an addon domain without using www if you want your website to be reachable this way, (example: yourwebsite.com).
In order to do that, you can configure an A record (Aname) in your DNS zone pointing to one of the following IP addresses:
13.248.140.34


76.223.14.214


These are the new addresses that are replacing the previous address: (52.210.201.133)
Important note, If you are using 52.210.201.133, you need to change to one of the new IP address as we will not be able to keep supporting this one on March 29th 2023.
If you need assistance doing this change, please contact our support team and we will be happy to assist you with the modifications. Please make sure to have access to your registrar (Gandi, OVH, Godaddy…) so we can assist you in performing this change. 
The details are also available on our manual.
Thanks,</span>
