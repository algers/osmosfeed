Tailscale uses Google as one of the possible identity providers for creating and joining a tailnet. Users who have emails with the same domain name can automatically sign in using SSO and be added to the corresponding tailnet (unless user approval is turned on for the tailnet)​​.

From 1:43 PM PST on December 19, 2023 to 10:25 AM PST on December 20, 2023, a small number of users experienced seeing blurred file previews. We discovered that this affected users with international data residency enabled in their workspace.


A change was made to our file storage, resulting in unexpected behaviour with file previews. We promptly identified the problematic code and reverted back the change in an effort to prevent file previews from becoming blurred. 

We later ran a script to fix affected files to display with clear previews, resolving the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - At 2023-12-18 20:03 UTC, our monitoring flagged an increase in GitRPC response errors that resulted from a change that was made that caused backend replicas to temporarily become out of sync while the change was deployed. During this time, approximately 2,500 users across 8,200 repos would have seen the merge button disabled or received failures from the merge API endpoint.
Upon discovering the failures, our engineers assessed that the shortest path to resolution was to roll forward and manually deploy to the remaining hosts, which resolved the issue at 2023-12-18 21:26.

Update - Git Operations is operating normally.
Dec 18, 21:19 UTC
Update - We&#x27;re seeing issues related to Pull Requests impacting a small number of users. We are aware deploying a fix and expect to resolve within the next 60 minutes.

Incident Report
Summary
On 07 December 2023, various Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers experienced intermittent authentication issues when routed to one of our data centers in the US East region. As a result, a limited number of users could not sign-up, login, or re-authenticate for a duration of 1 hour and 32 minutes.
To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers who were impacted during this issue, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.
Root Cause
Google’s authentication stack is broad and deep, running across every region and zone to provide functionality globally across all Google products. This particular issue was scoped to a single microservice&#x27;s serving jobs within a single data center; this microservice handles serving some of the user-facing pages involved in sign-up, login, and re-authentication flows.
To improve resource usage efficiency, engineers had been implementing more advanced autoscaling algorithms across these serving jobs globally. These changes were rolled out gradually over a period of several weeks without any issues.
On 7 December, the rollout kicked off rolling restarts across the individual tasks within the serving jobs in a single data center in the US East region. Due to internal network routing at the time, this data center was serving traffic from the US East area as well as South America. These factors placed additional demand on each task&#x27;s thread pool, both overloading some tasks and affecting those tasks&#x27; ability to report metrics back to load-balancers. This caused requests to be intermittently dropped between the load-balancer and the individual serving tasks; these dropped requests led to user-facing 500 error pages.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted by our internal monitoring system on 07 December at 11:16 US/Pacific and immediately started investigating the issue. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers worked to confirm that traffic could be safely re-routed away from the impacted serving jobs as a mitigation strategy. Traffic was rerouted to other data centers, and the customer impact was mitigated by 12:32 US/Pacific. Our engineers then reviewed and tuned the stability and performance of both this and related serving jobs globally before declaring the incident fully resolved.
Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business. We are committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and are completing the following actions:
Enhance metrics and dashboards to make these complex load-balancing dynamics more legible to engineers, reducing the time to mitigate similar future issues.
Improve performance-testing of resource-allocation profiles for each individual serving job
Detailed Description of Impact
Google Workspace:
During the issue, a limited number Google Workspace users served from this data center had issues with log-in and sign-up for part of unauthenticated traffic, including some users going through &quot;Sign in with Google &#x27;&#x27; interactive flows using their Google Workspace account
Multiple Google Workspace product log-in attempts, reauthentication attempts, and some new account creation requests from users routed to this data center failed with error 502s.
Users that were already logged in were not affected by the issue.
Google OAuth:
Some users served from this data center intermittently experienced error 502s when attempting to &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; and encountering interactive sign-in or re-authentication flows.
Google Cloud Console:
A limited number of  users served from this data center experienced error 502s intermittently when attempting to log-in to the Cloud Console.

Resolved - From 17:53 - 18:22 UTC, we experienced an issue impacting networking in our BLR1 region, with an impact to internal DigitalOcean services.
During that time, public networking for customer services like Droplets and Droplet-based products was not impacted. However, users experienced issues with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for services in BLR1, such as creating Droplets, managing Spaces Buckets, etc. Additionally, Cloud Firewalls were unable to be applied to services in BLR1 during that timeframe.
Our Engineering team has resolved the issue and all services should be functioning normally.
We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.</span>

On December 3, 2023 from 4:35 PM PST to around 5:29 PM PST, a small number of customers experienced trouble loading parts of Slack such as threads, channels, and direct messages. Affected customers may have also had trouble sending messages and running some workflows.


One of our databases experienced a minor hardware issue. This triggered an automatic intervention from our redundancy systems, and a new database was brought into service. However, the new database entered a state where it could not successfully respond to incoming queries.


As an immediate mitigation step, we performed a manual replacement and redirected the incoming queries to a third database. This resolved the issue for all impacted customers.</span>

Resolved - On December 1st, GitHub’s internal metrics highlighted increased latency for Copilot Chat requests. We declared an incident while investigating and discovered that the issue was only affecting GitHub employees. It was caused by a performance issue in a recently enabled feature that was only available internally.
We resolved the issue by disabling the feature.
The team has invested in improved telemetry, monitoring, and playbooks for Copilot Chat to ensure we can accurately assess impact and respond appropriately to alerting.
Dec  1, 17:36 UTC
Update - A small percentage of Copilot Chat users are still experiencing long request times and errors. We are still investigating to determine the root cause.
Dec  1, 16:41 UTC
Update - Some customers are experiencing higher latency for Copilot Chat. We are continuing our investigation.
Dec  1, 15:55 UTC
Update - Copilot is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.
Dec  1, 15:53 UTC
Update - We are investigating reports that that some customers are experiencing increased latency and failed requests for Copilot Chat.
Dec  1, 15:49 UTC

Resolved - Beginning around 16:48 UTC, our Engineering team identified an issue impacting a subset of Droplets in our BLR1 region. From 16:48 UTC to 17:45 UTC, impacted Droplets did not have correctly functioning networking capabilities. Additionally, users were unable to perform any events (such as power off, recycle, resize, etc) and any changes to the Cloud Firewalls for impacted Droplets were not being applied.
Our Engineering team has resolved the issue and networking and the Cloud Firewalls on all Droplets should be functioning normally.  
We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.</span>

From 9:30 AM PST on November 28, 2023 to 12:30 AM PST on November 29, 2023, some users in Asia were experiencing issues with Slack loading. Most of the impacted users were in Japan and India.


We traced this back to an unexpected spike in a database load for which we quickly saw recovery.


We monitored the situation closely and as the load reduced without intervention, we did not take any mitigating actions.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
Nov 28, 19:36 UTC
Update - We were not able to publish webhooks in response to push events triggered between 16:23 and 17:12 UTC. To avoid further disruption to customer workflows, we’ve decided not to continue our attempts to re-process those events. 
Workflows that trigger on pull_request or git push events may not have been run during this time period. 
You can run impacted workflows manually or by pushing a new commit to the same branch.
Nov 28, 18:09 UTC
Update - Customers saw push event deliveries for Actions and Webhooks fail between 16:23 and 17:12 (UTC). We fixed the issue, and we are working to re-process push events for the affected time period.
Nov 28, 18:09 UTC
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. An interaction between two feature flag rollouts caused us to suppress delivery of push webhooks between 16:23 and 17:11 UTC in a manner that evaded our existing observability. This affected 71,000 repositories whose users will have noted missing webhook deliveries and/or experienced Actions jobs with push triggers failing to start. During this period, around 25% of new Actions jobs were impacted. The issues were resolved by disabling one of the feature flags in question.
After weighing various options for retroactively dispatching old push webhooks, we concluded that the risk of delivering stale data to customers with these redeliveries outweighed the possible benefit.
As follow up to this incident, we are working to improve monitoring of webhook throughput and to document a policy around webhook redelivery timelines.
Nov 28, 17:59 UTC
Update - Actions is operating normally.
Nov 28, 17:36 UTC
Update - Customers saw pull requests push event deliveries for Actions and Webhooks fail between 16:23 and 17:12 (UTC). We fixed the issue, and we are working to re-process push events for the affected time period.
Nov 28, 17:24 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions and Webhooks</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
On November 27, 2023 at 18:46 UTC, we attempted to rotate our OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow certificates. Due to an error in the certificate formatting, we uploaded an invalid certificate configuration that was not observed in our pre-production testing. Our background job servers were unable to start because a valid configuration is required at worker start up. As a result, users experienced delays in Pull Requests, Webhooks, Issues, Actions and Projects. Rollback of the change was slowed by the invalid certificate as our deployment system relied on the same certificate. Rollback was completed at 20:35 UTC. Most services recovered by 20:44 UTC. 

Delayed updates to Issues and Pull Requests were applied normally once…</span>
