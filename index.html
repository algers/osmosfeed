Mini Incident Report
We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.
(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 21 September 2023 14:00
Incident End: 22 September 2023 07:10
Duration: 17 hours, 10 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Google Workspace Admin Console
Regions/Zones: Global
Description:
Google Workspace experienced issues with new domain creations for a duration of 17 hours, 10 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent change that prevented email verification of the initial user (superuser) on new domains prior to the domain being verified.
Customer Impact:
During the time of impact, the first user (superuser) for new domains would have been unable to access any Google Workspace products. Additional users added to new domains and existing domains were not impacted.
Additional details:
The issue was mitigated by rolling back the change at 07:10 US/Pacific on 22 September.

On September 21, 2023 from 3:00 PM PDT to 8:30 PM PDT, some users encountered a message stating &quot;Something went wrong&quot; when accessing the Slack Connect invites page.


We determined that rate limits set for querying invites were the cause of the &quot;Something went wrong&quot; message. These limits were set prior to the  product decision to include these in the Activity view. Because use of this view has increased, the limits are reached much sooner than originally expected.


These limits were lifted for the invites page, resolving the issue for users. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</span>

From September 6, 2023 at 9:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 3:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.</span>

Resolved - From 6:25pm PDT - 6:46pm PDT, we experienced an issue that prevented users from accessing Notion. The issue has been resolved, so users should be able to access Notion again. We&#x27;ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we experience other issues.
Root cause: 
One of our memcache clusters crashed and caused our API cluster to get stuck. Engineering resolved the issue by restarting them. We’ll continue to investigate on what caused the cluster to crash.</span>

From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.</span>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…</span>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…</span>

From 11:00 PM PDT on September 1, 2023 to 01:00 AM PDT on September 2, 2023, some users in India may have had issues with the messaging functionality in Slack.


We determined that the issue was caused by too many requests causing our database to be overwhelmed.


To resolve the issue, we created additional hosts and redistributed the requests which fixed the issue for affected users. 


Thank you for your patience while we sorted this out.</span>

On August 23, 2023 from 4:30 PM PDT to August 31, 2023 11:26 PM PDT, some users experienced an issue posting messages in the designated #general channel of their workspace. 


Our team identified that recent changes in our code broke some conditional logic and deprecated the preference that allows users to post in the #general channel.


We pushed out a fix and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue.</span>

From 11:32 PM PDT on August 29, 2023 to 02:06 AM PDT on August 30, 2023, some users may have seen an internal server or connection error in workflow and app modals.


We determined that a code change inadvertently caused an issue where incorrect data was stored in our database. When a modal was opened it used this incorrect data and displayed a connection error to users.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On August 28, 2023 from 4:30 AM PDT to 10:30 AM PDT, less than 1% of Slack users encountered slowness when loading channels, DMs, and threads. Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.


We found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. 


We restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. 


We&#x27;re continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.</span>

On August 24, 2023 between 10:41 AM PDT to 4:10 PM PDT, channel sections were missing from some users&#x27; sidebars.


We determined that a recent update in code failed to process an older format of data objects coming from our cache.


While we reverted this change and saw the majority of the issue resolved, this action caused an issue localized to the new data format and some users were still affected. 


Once we pushed a fix to normalize and handle all objects in the cache, channel sections were restored for all impacted users.</span>
