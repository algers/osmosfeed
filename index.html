Incident Report
Summary
On Thursday, 6 July 2023, Gmail experienced elevated errors in some of its core functionalities due to internal task issues. This occurred for 1 hour and 27 minutes starting at 15:22 PT. On Monday, 10 July 2023, the impact reoccurred for a period of 42 minutes between 18:37 to 19:19. During the period of impact,  some Gmail users experienced intermittent unavailability to a number of services, including syncing email to their clients, uploading attachments, initial page loads, and email deliveries. To our Gmail users who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
Gmail uses an internal triggering process system, built on an internal Spanner queue receiver, to perform asynchronous processing of the incoming messages in the Gmail backend.
The root cause of the incident is due to an unintended configuration change made in one of the internal proxy layers that handles Spanner queue receivers. However, it inadvertently reduced the callback size limit of the Spanner queue receiver resulting in throttling of the queue, which caused elevated memory pressure of the backend servers while handling the backlog of messages.
Google engineers mitigated the issue by rolling back the incorrect change and performed a controlled release of the messages to ensure the backend servers were resourced.
Remediation and Prevention
On Thursday July 6, 2023 at 15:22, Google engineers were alerted to the issue from the monitoring tools in place, and started working on multiple mitigation strategies to restore the service.
There was a spike in traffic from a single problematic trigger, which caused memory pressures on the backend servers. Google engineers paused the processing of this trigger and implemented temporary throttles and began to slowly ramp up the processing of this trigger to clean up the backlog of tasks.
On Monday July 10, 2023, Google engineers noticed that an incorrect configuration change had been rolled out after the issue on Thursday that caused a recurrence. Google engineers implemented a controlled ramp of the processing of the trigger, similar to the mitigation that was performed on July 6. However, one partition of production traffic was missed during this procedure and caused follow-on impact starting at 18:47. To prevent further user impact, engineers paused the processing of the trigger again, and as a result user impact began to subside at around 19:15. Google engineers performed cleanup of this trigger at a controlled pace over the course of the next few weeks.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future. Google engineers have set up a conservative limit for throttling the incoming load. This is to ensure the memory utilization is within the limits.
Google is also completing the following actions:
Implement additional safeguards around change management while system improvements are being developed
Detailed Description of Impact
On Thursday, 6 July 2023 between 15:15 and 16:47 PT, a portion of Gmail users experienced some IMAP unavailability, which resulted in asynchronous syncing issues between their clients and their mailboxes. Users may have experienced errors when syncing mail and with settings in their clients, issues with initial page loads, one or more errors accessing Gmail’s external API through the API Server, an inbound delivery delay, or an outbound delay.
On Monday, 10 July 2023 between 18:37 and 19:19, a portion of Gmail users received errors attempting to sync their clients to their mailboxes, upload attachments and load ads, or load their web client for the first time. Meanwhile some users experienced IMAP errors, errors from Sync Server, and unavailability when accessing the API Server. Email delivery was also impacted, with some inbound emails temporarily delayed.

On July 13, 2023 between 12:19 PM PDT and 12:36 PM PDT, some users encountered errors which led to being unable to load threads, send DMs, joining channels, and accessing Slack overall.


This issue was a result of a failed host in our database infrastructure. We quickly replaced this host, fixing the problem for all impacted users.


Users should no longer be experiencing any trouble accessing Slack.</span>

Resolved - We have backfilled message threads for the reservations that were affected during this time window. You should now be able to retrieve the &#x60;thread_id&#x60; associated with a reservation using the Reservations API. Apologies for the inconvenience.
If you have any further queries related to this incident, please submit a ticket via the Partner Support Portal and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
Jul 12, 12:25 PDT
Identified - We have identified an issue that caused reservations to be created without associated threads. This occurred between 10:15 PM and 11:29 PM on July 12th (PST), so notifications for reservations created during that time were sent with a null &#x60;thread_id&#x60; value.
We are actively working on creating threads for reservations that do not have them, and will update here afterwards.
Once this is done, you will be able to retrieve the &#x60;thread_id&#x60; value for a reservation using the Reservations API.</span>

We would like to inform you that we will deploy a nice improvement to your websites.
Starting today, all Smily websites will be under SSL certificates.
There is nothing you have to do on your side, this change will be automatic and shall not impact your website’s accessibility.
What does it mean ?
Your website’s URL will be starting with https:// and no longer http://.
What are the benefits of this change ?
Websites are more secured
Better user experience
Users stay longer and buy more on secured websites
Sites with HTTPS load faster
HTTPS leads to accurate SEO reporting
Better SEO : SSL is a positive ranking factor for Google. Google’s team has expressed the need for HTTPS time and time again. So much so that they’ve released an algorithm update based on it—causing sites without HTTPS security to struggle on their quest to rank highly in the search engines results.
Feel free to reach out to us if you have any question !</span>

On July 6, 2023 between 06:21 AM PDT and 10:58 AM PDT, some users were experiencing issues with messages sent with an attached file and app mention. They were incorrectly displaying an error &quot;This message contains interactive elements&quot;.


As we looked into it further, we traced the problem to a formatting issue, which resulted in missing metadata for the messages sent. Reverting a recent change fixed the issue for all affected customers.</span>

Hello, 
During the above window, our Engineering team will be performing maintenance on redundant upstream electrical systems in order to improve reliability in our FRA1 region.
Expected Impact:
We don&#x27;t expect to see any downtime as the power to hypervisors are redundant. In a highly unlikely situation, where we lose power to both the supplies, the Droplets in FRA1 may experience downtime for a brief period. We will endeavor to keep this to a minimum for the duration of the change.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket
Thank you,

On Wednesday June 28th, 2023 from 10:35 AM PDT to 1:55 PM PDT, some customers experienced delays in loading threads. This was caused by a strain on our databases due to some unusually data-heavy tasks running in the background.

On June 30, 2023 from 8:12 AM PDT to 4:23 PM PDT, some users may have had trouble signing in to Slack with magic login codes or via the &#x27;Sign In With Email&#x27; button. 


A code change inadvertently introduced a logic error in the sign-in flow. We identified the error and deployed an initial fix to correct the flawed logic. This resolved the problem with the &#x27;Sign In With Email&#x27; button. After further investigation, we deployed a second correction to address the trouble with magic login codes, resolving the issue for all affected customers.


We believed the first fix had resolved the problem for all customers, and we updated the status site accordingly. However, we discovered that the issue with magic login codes had not been addressed, and we posted a separate notice on the status site while we investigated further. We apologize for any confusion and for calling the all clear too quickly. 


We have updated the titles for both entries so that they match.</span>
