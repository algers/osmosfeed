From September 6, 2023 at 9:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 3:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
On Friday, 25 August 2023, some ChromeOS device users experienced failures which prevented user sign in. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
The root cause is due to a combination of unexpected increased traffic and an inefficient code in the policy fetch that created excessive objects. The device management server was unable to handle requests from client devices as the compute usage spiked above its limit. This ultimately impacted all requests, as the device management server was triggered to auto reject requests.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were internally alerted to the ChromeOS outage on 25 August at 08:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers quickly identified an increase in usage on the device management servers and took steps to remove the blockage that was causing requests to be rejected, this mitigated the issue and allowed traffic to return to normal and for successful requests to process on 25 August  at 11:40 US/Pacific.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Optimize the current capacity limit alerting to detect excessive usage quicker

Resolved - From 6:25pm PDT - 6:46pm PDT, we experienced an issue that prevented users from accessing Notion. The issue has been resolved, so users should be able to access Notion again. We&#x27;ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we experience other issues.
Root cause: 
One of our memcache clusters crashed and caused our API cluster to get stuck. Engineering resolved the issue by restarting them. We’ll continue to investigate on what caused the cluster to crash.</span>

From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.</span>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…</span>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…</span>

From 11:00 PM PDT on September 1, 2023 to 01:00 AM PDT on September 2, 2023, some users in India may have had issues with the messaging functionality in Slack.


We determined that the issue was caused by too many requests causing our database to be overwhelmed.


To resolve the issue, we created additional hosts and redistributed the requests which fixed the issue for affected users. 


Thank you for your patience while we sorted this out.</span>

Monitoring - Our Engineering team has observed some improvement in the networking routes between NYC and the Western EU, including FRA, AMS, and LON.
Due to the general nature of internet outages, DigitalOcean users may still experience degraded network performance in the form of increased latency and/or packet loss on these routes for Droplets, Droplet-based services, and App Platform builds and deployments.
We’ll continue to monitor the situation through the next few days and provide any needed updates. If you experience any issues, feel free to open a support ticket and our team will be happy to assist. (edited)

Identified - Our Engineering team is aware of an upstream issue impacting networking routes between NYC and the Western EU, including FRA, AMS, and LON.
Despite routing path changes made, DigitalOcean services continue to see impact. The issues are a direct result of subsea fiber faults, which are in the process of being repaired. 
DigitalOcean users may experience degraded network performance in the form of increased latency and/or packet loss on these routes for Droplets and Droplet-based services. 
Additionally, we&#x27;ve identified this issue is impacting App Platform builds and deployments, leading to latency or failures.

On August 23, 2023 from 4:30 PM PDT to August 31, 2023 11:26 PM PDT, some users experienced an issue posting messages in the designated #general channel of their workspace. 


Our team identified that recent changes in our code broke some conditional logic and deprecated the preference that allows users to post in the #general channel.

From 11:32 PM PDT on August 29, 2023 to 02:06 AM PDT on August 30, 2023, some users may have seen an internal server or connection error in workflow and app modals.


We determined that a code change inadvertently caused an issue where incorrect data was stored in our database. When a modal was opened it used this incorrect data and displayed a connection error to users.

                              <span>Issue summary:

On August 28, 2023 from 4:30 AM PDT to 10:30 AM PDT, less than 1% of Slack users encountered slowness when loading channels, DMs, and threads. Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.


We found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. 


We restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. 


We&#x27;re continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.</span>

On August 24, 2023 between 10:41 AM PDT to 4:10 PM PDT, channel sections were missing from some users&#x27; sidebars.


We determined that a recent update in code failed to process an older format of data objects coming from our cache.


While we reverted this change and saw the majority of the issue resolved, this action caused an issue localized to the new data format and some users were still affected. 


Once we pushed a fix to normalize and handle all objects in the cache, channel sections were restored for all impacted users.</span>

We determined that a recent backend code change was erroneously detecting certain users as deactivated, which in turn was causing these users requests to upload files to be rejected. We reverted this change, which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team identified an issue with the DigitalOcean Docs site (https://docs.digitalocean.com), resulting in all users attempting to view the main site or any docs pages seeing 500 errors. 
Beginning around 16:55 UTC, the Docs site became unavailable following a complication with a deploy. At 17:16, our Engineering team triggered a new deploy and the site came back online. 
We apologize for the disruption. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out through a Support ticket from within your account.</span>

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale client, combined with a behavior
of the UPnP implementations in some routers, could expose all UDP ports of a
node to external networks (usually the internet).
As of 2023-08-22 2:30 AM UTC, we have changed the Tailscale coordination server
to advise nodes to stop using UPnP for port mapping. In some cases this can
degrade NAT traversal and may cause some connections to route through DERP.
This may increase node-to-node latency and decrease throughput. Version 1.48.1
resolves the issue and re-enables port mapping via UPnP.
What happened?
Tailscale nodes use UPnP as one of the mechanisms to open UDP port forwarding
in routers to help with NAT traversal. Tailscale picks a node port and an
external router port and requests forwarding between them. On firs…</span>

On August 21, 2023 from 8:00 AM PDT to 8:51 AM PDT, less than 1% of users experienced trouble loading Slack.


We determined that a recent code change on our back end was resulting in a higher than expected memory footprint, and that this combined with high traffic loads was causing these issues.


We immediately rolled back this change, which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

On August 17, 2023 from 9:20 AM PDT to 9:37 AM PDT, some users encountered issues with messages not sending and channels and threads failing to load.


We determined that a recent indexing change caused a higher than expected level of requests to our database. The resulting high load errors were responsible for the impacted users&#x27; inability to load messages and channels.


We immediately reverted this change, which resolved the issue for affected users. We then deployed a fix to prevent this from reoccurring in the future.</span>

Monitoring - The mitigation performed by our Engineering team has been confirmed as resolving customer impact for the issue with VPC&#x27;s in NYC3. 
We&#x27;ll continue to monitor for a short period and will post an update once we confirm this issue is fully resolved.
Aug 17, 00:22 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team identified an issue with VPC Connectivity for resources in our NYC3 region. 
Users creating new resources were not able to place them correctly into VPC&#x27;s in NYC3 via API create requests. Users also saw network connectivity errors between members of NYC3 VPC&#x27;s. This issue impacted Droplet-based products like Load Balances and Managed Kubernetes clusters as well, manifesting in various VPC-related errors.
Our team was able to mitigate this issue and we&#x27;re currently monitoring the situation. As of 00:00 UTC, users should see normal VPC behavior in NYC3. 
We apologize for the disruption and will post another update shortly.</span>

We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team for further review.

Update - Our Engineering team continues work on the rollout with the fix for Python builds failing in App Platform. 
We&#x27;ve identified that a very small number of Apps are impacted by this issue - less than 1% of users have encountered this issue. 
We will post an update once the rollout completes.

Identified - Our Engineering team has investigated and identified an issue impacting Python builds for App Platform. Beginning approximately 17:30 UTC, users will see the error &quot;Requested runtime &#x27;python-3.11.3&#x27; is not available for this stack (heroku-18)&quot;. 
The team is in the process of rolling out a fix. 
In the meantime as a workaround, users may update their Apps to use the Ubuntu 22.04-based stack. This stack is in beta, but provides dependency upgrades, and removes support for PHP version 8.0 and earlier. To update, users will need to specify the new stack in the app spec by adding: 
&quot;features:
    - buildpack-stack&#x3D;ubuntu-22&quot;
We will post another update once the fix has completed rolling out.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug 15, 18:02 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug 15, 17:06 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-15 18:00 UTC
End: 2023-08-15 22:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the FRA1 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug 14, 20:12 UTC
Update - Our Engineering team has completed the rollback and VPC connectivity for all Droplets and Droplet-based services is restored. 
We&#x27;ll now continue this maintenance as scheduled. 
We apologize for the brief interruption.
Aug 14, 20:03 UTC
Verifying - Our Engineering team has identified an issue stemming from this maintenance, which impacts approximately 1-3% of Droplets and Droplet-based services in our FRA1 region. 
At this time, a small percentage of customers will experience VPC network connectivity issues. An emergency rollback is already underway to mitigate this issue. 
We will update this post with further information as soon as possible.
Aug 14, 18:42 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug 14, 18:41 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-14 18:00 UTC
End: 2023-08-14 22:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the FRA1 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase. 
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

Resolved - From 23:16 - 04:00, updates to DigitalOcean Container Registry images were not displayed correctly in the UI (Cloud Control Panel), due to a lapsed internal authorization token. Our Engineering team was able to issue a new token and rolled out the change regionally in order to not disrupt multiple data planes at once. 
This issue is fully resolved. If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Aug 12, 03:54 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has confirmed the root cause of the issue with updates to the UI for DigitalOcean Container Registry and a fix is now rolling out regionally. 
As this rolls out, we expect users to once again be able to see updates to Container Registry images in the UI (Cloud Control Panel). 
We will post another update once the fix finishes rolling out in all regions.
Aug 12, 02:09 UTC
Identified - From 23:16 UTC, our Engineering team has identified an issue with DigitalOcean Container Registry and is actively working on a fix. During this time, customers will not be able to see changes on UI for new DOCR Images in multiple regions. We will post an update as soon as additional information is available.</span>
