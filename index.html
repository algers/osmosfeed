                              <span>Incident began at 2023-04-14 07:00 (times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)).

The fix has now been deployed to the Beta release channel and available to customers. Customers wishing to expedite the update can switch impacted rooms to the Beta release channel which typically takes 2-4 hours to propagate after which time the subsequent reboots of the device should not experience the issue.
We plan to release this fix to the Stable release channel the week of April 24th after we have ensured a successful roll out to Beta.
We request any customers that opt to switch their rooms to the Beta channel should switch them back to Stable channel after the update to ensure the devices remain on the stable release track.
More information on how to change between Beta and Stable channels is available here : https://support.google.com/a/answer/4618201?hl&#x3D;en&amp;ref_topic&#x3D;3341450&amp;visit_id&#x3D;638176138740742021-1958539996&amp;rd&#x3D;1#settings&amp;zippy&#x3D;%2Cchange-settings-for-all-devices
We will provide more information by Friday, 2023-04-21 14:00 US/Pacific
Workaround :
Customers affected with this issue may try the following steps for mitigation if the reboot does not fix the issue.
Unplug network cable on the Meet Hardware device.
Reboot the device.
Wait until it shows the network connectivity screen (this is the screen that prompts the user to select a wifi connection).
Plug in network cable back into the Meet hardware device.
Device should recover after this step is completed.

Mitigation work is currently underway by our engineering team. We have a fix that is currently being tested by our team, and plan to release it to the Beta channel by Thursday, 2023-04-20 18:00 US/Pacific. Customers wishing to expedite the update can switch impacted  rooms to the Beta release channel. This update typically takes 2-4 hours to update after the switch to the Beta release channel, and would require a restart after this time period.
We plan to release this fix to the Stable release channel the week of April 24th after we have ensured a successful roll out to Beta.
We request any customers who opt to switch their rooms to the Beta channel to switch them back to Stable channel after the update, to ensure the devices remain back on the stable release process
More information on how to change between Beta and Stable channels is available here : https://support.google.com/a/answer/4618201?hl&#x3D;en&amp;ref_topic&#x3D;3341450&amp;visit_id&#x3D;638176138740742021-1958539996&amp;rd&#x3D;1#settings&amp;zippy&#x3D;%2Cchange-settings-for-all-devices
Our engineering team has also identified a workaround for devices that are not able to get past the &quot;Waiting for application window&quot; screen after a reboot. Please refer to the workaround section for details.
We will provide more information by Thursday, 2023-04-20 18:00 US/Pacific
We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On April 20th, 2023 from 6:00 AM PDT until 7:45 AM PDT, a small number of users experienced latency issues when using Slack. Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. 


The issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. 


Our team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.

We are happy to announce that new damage deposit payment settings are now available in your Smily account. Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.
Why the changes?
Up until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings &gt; Payments &gt; Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.
Both options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.

                              <span>Issue summary:


On April 16rd, 2023 from 12:11 PM PDT until 14:39 PM PDT, certain Android users on the Free plan reported issues with loading channels in the Android app.  


Upon investigation, this was attributed to the implementation of a data optimization feature, intended to improve app performance. We have rolled back this feature temporarily, which has corrected the observed issue.  A full investigation and remedy will take place prior to reimplementation. 


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this.  We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

On April 10, 2023 at 7:30 PM PDT, some customers began experiencing delays when uploading files. We traced the issue back to a recent update made to how some file uploads are handled. Reverting this change fixed the issue, and customers were no longer experiencing it as of April 11, 2023 at 7:33 AM PDT.

Resolved - While we still await details from Twitter the only way how to create a connection at this moment is to have every user to create their own Twitter app at developer.twitter.com and use the apps API Key and API Key Secret to create a new connection in Make. We updated our documentation with details about how to obtain API Key and API Key Secret - https://www.make.com/en/help/apps/marketing/twitter#obtaining-api-key-and-api-key-secret-values-for-your-twitter-account
Apr  3, 23:56 CEST
Update - Twitter has suspended our app. We are continuing to investigate.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jul  5, 13:00 PDT
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jun 30, 10:55 PDT
Scheduled - As announced on July 5, 2021 we are deprecating our XML API connection.
XML listings can no longer be activated: this means that new XML listings will remain unlisted even if you set 
true
. The same is valid for existing listing that are deactivated (i.e. you will not be able to reactivate a XML listing if it gets unlisted).

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed tailnets created by GitHub organizations which were subsequently renamed to be associated with a new GitHub organization with the previous name.
What happened?
Tailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.
Who is affected?
Up to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name. Additiona…</span>

On April 3rd, 2023 from 11:00 AM PDT until 11:45 AM PDT, users on certain cellular service networks had issues receiving SMS texts for two-factor authentication (2FA). 


Upon investigation, this was traced to one unverified toll free number, which prevented 2FA codes from being approved for delivery. That number was removed from our 2FA pool, and services have resumed as usual. We are reviewing our process and alerting around outgoing phone number verification to ensure the issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.</span>

From March 31st, 2023 at 7:18 PM PDT to April 1st, 2023 at 11:30 AM PDT, some customers may not have been able to sign in to Slack with the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. 


During a routine cleanup process, we made some changes to the project behind the &#x27;Continue with Google&#x27; feature. This change inadvertently prevented the Slack mobile apps from confirming the validity of customer Google accounts during login. 


We reverted this change, restoring normal login behaviour for all affected customers, and we&#x27;re working to ensure it does not happen again. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

Resolved - We have identified and resolved an internal issue that resulted in reservation webhook notifications being sent with $0 price. The incident was active between 13:40 and 14:20 PDT. Reservations payments were processed correctly, but nightly prices and fees appeared as $0 within the webhooks. Please use the GET Reservations API to retrieve the correct reservations prices. Alternatively, please contact the API Integrations team for additional help.
Apologies for the inconvenience.</span>

On March 21, 2023 at 7:32 AM PDT to March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT, the &quot;Time when workflow started&quot; variable is missing from all steps of the Workflow Builder for new and existing workflows. If the variable was used to publish to a Google Sheet, the cell would be empty.


We discovered a bug that made date fields invisible without any errors displayed, though workflows were still running and had access to the value.


We have released a fix on March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT. Previously impacted workflows need to retrieve the timestamps from the workflow in the Workflow Builder. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out.</span>
