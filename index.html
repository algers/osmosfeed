Resolved - We resolved the issue with Facebook OAuth app. Now, everything should be back to normal.
Reauthorization of your Facebook connection is not needed. If you experience issues with your Facebook connection, please, go to Connection tab, find your Facebook connection and click the button &quot;Reauthorize&quot;. Then, follow the steps in the new window, where you confirm access to your Facebook account.

Investigating - Facebook and Instagram apps
Facebook has temporarily revoked our Facebook OAuth app. Therefore, Facebook and Instagram connections in Integromat and Make have expired.
We are working on a fix ASAP. You might need to reauthorize your Facebook connection then.
Affected apps: Facebook, Facebook Ads Campaign Management, Facebook Catalogs, Facebook Conversions API, Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Groups, Facebook Insights, Facebook Lead Ads, Facebook Offline Conversions, Facebook Pages, Instagram for Business.</span>

Â Â 
Good news! After releasing the new calendar interface, many of you reacted, we thank you for that, and we heard your feedbacks ! 
We did some evolutions to adapt the calendar new interface and make it match your needs. 
What are the main evolutions?
1- More listings displayed
In the first version of new calendar interface the planning was limited to 25 properties, now it goes up to 100 properties.
2- The filters
Few hours after the release we enabled all the 8 filters !
3- The logos more visible
The logos of the sources are now colored in white, it makes them more visible 
Small tipðŸ’¡
Some of you need to visualize more properties on the planning view.
If you zoom out your calendar page you can make the lines thinner and be able to see more properties.

We invite you to discover all these evolutions, and hope it will help you to have a better management of your calendar, save more time, and make more bookings !
Wishing you all a pleasant day!</span>

Resolved - This incident has been fully resolved.

Update - Due to the DDoS attack, Make servers were unable to receive some webhook requests from our customers and as a result, such data couldn&#x27;t be delivered to scenarios. In some instances data was redelivered at a later point, but in order to be sure, we advise that you reload any data from the app-list below that was uploaded during the following time frames (times shown in CET):
26.9.2022 18:00 - 27.9.2022 15:20
27.9.2022 19:20 - 27.9.2022 23:50
Our investigation revealed webhooks coming from those apps were affected:
Slack, Zoom, Facebook Lead Ads, Intercom, Segment, Todoist, Quickbooks, Square, Instagram, and Box

Starting September 21st around 1:00 PM PDT until September 28th 3:00 PM PDT, users experienced trouble downloading files on Slack&#x27;s Android app version: 22.09.30. We traced the problem to a permissions check error which caused file downloads to not execute.


We corrected the permissions check error in the latest version of the Android app: 22.09.40, and the file download functionality was restored. Some impacted users may need to update their Slack app to version 22.09.40 from the Google Play Store.</span>

Resolved - This incident was resolved on September 21st at 1:00 p.m. PDT. If you still see reservations missing webhook notifications, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach back out.
Sep 21, 14:46 PDT
Update - We are actively working to find a solution to this issue. In the meantime, we have backfilled all the missed reservation webhook notifications since September 15. We will post more updates as soon as we have them.

Identified - We have identified an issue affecting the sending of reservation related webhooks starting on September 15th, we are actively working on it and will post more updates when we have them. This incident does not affect all reservations, only a limited number of them. If you notice that some of your Hosts&#x27; reservations webhooks are missing, for example when you accept a make_reservation SAC, but you did not receive a confirmation webhook afterwards, use the GET reservations API to retrieve the reservation status.</span>

On September 26, 2022 from 12:00 PM PDT to 11:48 PM PDT, link formatting was broken for all Slack apps.


Some messages were showing the URL and not a link itself. We determined that this issue was caused by a recent code change that altered how attachment links in the app were formatted.


We reverted this change which fixed the issue for all users after a force reload of Slack.</span>

Full Incident Report
SUMMARY:
On Friday, 16 September at 10:23 US/Pacific, Cloud Support Systems, which utilizes a 3rd party product, experienced row-lock errors while updating cases. This preventedSupport agents from being able to update or make changes to some Support cases. Additionally, the send email to customers action was unavailable for some Support cases. Some customers may have seen an error when updating cases from the customer portal. As a workaround, customers and Support agents could successfully update their cases by retrying the action. The issue was mitigated at 17:27 US/Pacific and service was fully restored for both the Support agents and customers. The total duration of the service disruption was 7 hours and 4 minutes.
ROOT CAUSE:
Cloud Support Systems experienced a large backlog of case field update actions pending in the SLO timed actions queue. These timed actions were running in large batches, with updates running in the queue every few minutes. This caused the cases to be locked down from any other update actions while that job was running.
This backlog was caused by the following:
There was an increase in the limit of cases being processed every hour by the SLO time queue job.
There was a rollback issue with the 3rd party product while processing time based tasks which caused multiple processing requests of the same tasks.
There was a configuration in the case trigger which created a backlog on large batches which triggered the above bug with the 3rd party product.
REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:
Our engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal support agent&#x27;s case on Monday, 12 September 2022. Engineering began investigating and working on a solution. On Tuesday, September 13 there was one report of external impact. The issue progressed and impact became visible externally on Friday, 16 September 2022 at 10:23 US/Pacific, and the row lock issue was confirmed to have widespread external impact. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers filed a case with the 3rd party product support to address the issue with Cloud Systems. The  backlog actions were purged manually using the 3rd party setup UI which brought the backlog in the queue down by 80%, the issue was completely resolved for the end user on Friday, 16 September at 17:27 US/Pacific.
Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:
Implement a code enhancement with the 3rd party vendor to confirm the error handling code which triggered the issue is fixed.

As you may know, we were pleased to participate in the Vacation Rental World Summit in Porto last week as a Gold Sponsor !
This was the 6th edition of this event, which is becoming increasingly popular each year.
It provides an opportunity for us to meet our partners and customers. We are also always happy and curious to get to know new players in our amazing industry.
These shared moments exchanging with lots of different actors allow us to stay informed about trends and activity in the vacation rental industry.

                              <span>Issue summary:


Starting September 6th, 2022, we identified an issue with the Google Sheet app inside Workflow Builder. This issue caused the app to read the spreadsheet date/time format wrong, inserting the incorrect time value in the timestamp.


We discovered this was due to the app processing the workflow step with a single digit value instead of a double digit value.


Users can continue highlighting the Submission Time column in the spreadsheet and select Format â†’ Number â†’ Custom Number Format and insert: ddd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss, as a workaround.


We will work to fix this through a bug ticket that has been filed as a result of this incident. Though we have not resolved this issue yet, we will provide further updates through customer support tickets with the impacted users.</span>

Resolved - Some Partners may have encountered 500 Errors on the Listings API when attempting to API-connect listings to their applications earlier today.
We have identified the cause for which a fix has already been implemented. We are not expecting any further errors of such.
Thank you for your understanding and apologies for any inconvenience caused!</span>

On September 1st, 2022 from around 6:28 am to September 7th, 2022 around 3:00 pm PDT, some users on the Slack desktop app version 4.28.171 installed via the Windows Store were receiving an error when attempting to connect to Slack. 


We determined the cached information typically used to launch the app became corrupted, and subsequently caused the app to not load through a network request, prompting an error instead of re-trying the connection. We then launched a fix that allowed the app to re-attempt a network request, which solved the issue.</span>
