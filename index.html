                              <span>Issue Summary:


On February 1, 2024 between 12:57 AM PST and 3:52 AM PST, some users in Germany were having trouble receiving two-factor authentication codes via SMS.


This was caused by an issue with a service provider and has now been resolved.


Users in Germany should no longer be having trouble and may also choose to use an authentication app to receive their 2FA codes instead of SMS.


Thank you for being patient with us, we appreciate it.</span>

The volume of API calls resulted in some users experiencing latency loading channels and general difficulties connecting to Slack. We investigated the impact with a broad lens and began to observe signs of recovery around 12:09 PM PST.


During this time, we cautiously observed our health metrics to ensure our servers were accurately recovering. As a result of our thorough monitoring, there was a delay before we could confirm the issue was fully resolved. Our teams have also put in measures to help reduce the likelihood of this occurring again in the future.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the workaround fix is successful and all services should now be operating normally. We will now close this incident and work with the DNS provider separately on the root cause. 
We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team for further review.
Jan 29, 18:18 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue with DNS resolution. DigitalOcean resolvers in use in FRA1, AMS3, and LON1 are unable to reach an upstream DNS provider, resulting in resolution for a subset of domain names being unavailable from our resolvers. Our Engineering team is reaching out to the provider for assistance.
In the meantime, our Engineering team has been able to implement a workaround fix by filtering some incorrectly announced network routes. At this time, we are seeing recovery and resolution of hostnames returning to normal in the impacted regions. We&#x27;ll continue to await an update from the DNS provider. We&#x27;re now monitoring the workaround fix for stability and will post an update once we are confident it is successful.
Jan 29, 17:27 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is currently investigating issues with DNS resolution in FRA1, AMS3, and LON1. During this time, customers may experience errors trying to resolve domain names from within DigitalOcean services in those regions, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as App Platform. Additionally, App Platform builds may fail or experience delays. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - On January 28, 2024, between 01:00 UTC and 14:00 UTC the Avatars service was degraded and could not return all avatar images requested by users, instead it would return a default, fallback avatar image. This incident impacted, at peak time 6% of the requests for viewing Avatars. Requests that were impacted did not prevent the users from continuing to use any GitHub services. This was due to an issue with the Avatars service connecting to a database host.
 We mitigated the incident by restarting the malfunctioning hosts that were not able to return the user avatar images.
 We are working to improve alerting and monitoring of our services to reduce our time to detection and mitigation.
Jan 28, 14:27 UTC
Update - We have mitigated all customer impact. We are no longer serving fallback avatar icons when loading web pages for some customers. We continue to monitor the results.

Update - A fix has been implemented for customers seeing the default avatar (octocat) when loading web pages and we are monitoring the results.
Jan 28, 13:20 UTC
Update - Some requests for getting the Avatars are returning the fallback response instead of the asked avatar since they are having issues connecting to the Mysql host

                              <span>Issue Summary:


From 1:00pm PST on January 23, 2024 to 2:30pm PST on January 23, 2024, some users encountered trouble uploading, downloading, and viewing files in Slack.


We determined that an API call was not functioning correctly, and made a change to mitigate the issue. The upload problems were caused by a slowing down of responses due to a higher than normal volume of API calls due to the malfunction. This issue has been resolved and steps have been taken to avoid it happening in the future.</span>

Live updates to Issues, PRs, Actions, and Projects were failing, but refreshing the page successfully updated page content. We resolved the issue by rolling back a problematic dependency update and reenabled live updates at 18:53 UTC. 
We are working to improve alerting and monitoring of our live update service to reduce our time to detection and mitigation.

                              <span>Issue summary:

From 12:20pm PST until 3:00pm PST on January 22, 2024, some Enterprise Grid users noticed multiple Slackbot responses being triggered unexpectedly.


We determined that the rollout of a fix for an older bug report pertaining to Slackbot responses not working in org-wide or multi-workspace channels, was the root cause. 


Whilst the fix for the bug was intended to improve this features behaviour, ensuring that Slackbot custom responses would work in these channel types, our wider team concluded that the fixed behaviour might not function well for organizations with potentially thousands of custom Slackbot responses.


We rolled back the deployment which caused this behaviour. Customers will no longer see these Slackbot custom responses being triggered unexpectedly.


A discussion is underway about the long-term future of Slackbot custom response behaviour within large organizations.


Thank you for your patience whilst we resolved this.</span>

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 at 3:38 UTC, we experienced an incident that affected customers using Codespaces. Customers encountered issues creating and resuming Codespaces in multiple regions due to operational issues with compute and storage resources.
Around 25% of customers were impacted, primarily in East US and West Europe. We re-routed traffic for Codespace creations to less impacted regions, but existing Codespaces in these regions may have been unable to resume during the incident.
By 7:30 UTC, we had recovered connectivity to all regions except West Europe, which had an extended recovery time due to increased load in that particular region. The incident was resolved on 2024-01-21 at 9:34 UTC once Codespace creations and resumes were working normally in all regions.

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 from 02:05 UTC to 06:19 UTC, GitHub Hosted Runners experienced increased error rates from our main cloud service provider. The errors were initially limited to a single region and we were able to route around the issue by transparently failing over to other regions. However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.
During the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.
We’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.
Jan 21, 05:54 UTC
Update - We&#x27;ve applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.
Jan 21, 05:26 UTC
Update - We have mitigated the issues impacting Actions Larger Runners. We are still experiencing delays starting normal jobs, and are continuing to investigate.
Jan 21, 04:53 UTC
Update - The team has identified the cause of the issues with Actions Larger Runners and has begun mitigation.
Jan 21, 04:16 UTC
Update - The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time and a percentage of jobs failing. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.
Jan 21, 03:45 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

From 11:26 AM PST on January 12, 2024 to 10:04 AM PST on January 15, 2024, some users were unable to configure 2FA on their accounts. We were made aware of this after a spike in reports early in the morning of Monday, January 15.


Upon investigation, this issue was traced back to a recent code change which we discovered was preventing users from being redirected back to the 2FA configuration page after entering their password during the 2FA setup process. We immediately reverted this change which fully resolved the issue.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From approximately 20:15 - 21:45 UTC, DigitalOcean experienced a global networking issue that impacted multiple services and products. Users saw increased error rates and latency for event processing, accessing our Cloud Control Panel/API, applying Cloud Firewall policies, accessing www.digitalocean.com and our Community site, and DNS resolution. Additionally, users saw timeouts/increased latency for networking requests to Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as connections to existing App Platform Apps. 
We sincerely apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience issues or have questions, please reach out to our Support team by opening a ticket from within your account. …</span>

Improvement
  
We&#x27;re thrilled to share a new feature we’ve just released for booking.com properties.
What&#x27;s New?
The rate rule Booking at least &#x27;x&#x27; day ahead is now synchronised on booking.com channel;
Why Does This Matter?
You were facing the obstacle where Guests were making a booking for the same day or &#x27;x&#x27; days (based on your settings) even though the setting to prevent that was activated;
-&gt; It won’t happen anymore.
What&#x27;s Next?
If you face any obstacle with this setting, reach out to us; 
We are and will be working on more improvements to make your day-to-day easier :)

Resolved - On January 9 between 12:45 and 13:56 UTC, services in one of our three sites experienced elevated latency for connections.  This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in c…</span>

Resolved - On January 9 between 1:06 and 5:43 UTC, no audit log events were streamed for customers that have that enabled. All events that happened during this time were delivered after the issue was mitigated. The event delivery was failing due to a data shape issue, with a streaming configuration linked to a soft-deleted Enterprise causing a runtime error for a backend service.  This was mitigated by removing that configuration.  Since the incident, we have improved our detection of these errors and ensured support for similar scenarios.
Jan  9, 05:40 UTC
Update - Audit logs streaming is currently unavailable due to a misconfiguration issue. The root cause is understood and our engineers will be updating the broken configuration shortly.
Jan  9, 04:59 UTC
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

Resolved - From January 5th to January 8th, Codespaces experienced issues with port forwarding when connecting from a web browser. During this incident 100% of operations to forward ports and connect to a forwarded port failed for customers located in US West and Australia. The cause was due to a cross origin API change in our port forwarding service. After detecting the issue, we mitigated the impact by rolling back the change that caused the discrepancy in the cross origin rules. We have improved the way we are detecting issues like this one including implementing automated alerts during and after the rollout process so that we get signals as early as possible.
Jan  8, 22:37 UTC
Update - The initial mitigation we attempted did not fully resolve this issue.  We are continuing to investigate and will provide an update as soon as possible.
Jan  8, 21:55 UTC
Update - We are engaged on the issue and continuing to work toward a mitigation. Please continue to fallback to VS Code desktop for port forwarding workflows.
Jan  8, 21:03 UTC
Update - Mitigation of degraded Codespaces port forwarding in is progress.  In the meantime, please continue to use VS Code Desktop for port forwarding.
Jan  8, 20:22 UTC
Update - We are actively mitigating degraded performance of Codespaces port forwarding in the web and GitHub CLI.  Codespaces port forwarding on VS Code Desktop is unaffected.

Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Codespaces</span>

                              <span>Description: On Windows before Tailscale version 1.52 and on Linux before
Tailscale 1.54, the tailscale serve and tailscale funnel features allowed
users to serve the contents of directories that their user account could not
access, but which the tailscaled service process could.
What happened?
A user could escalate their own file read access by running, for example,
tailscale.exe serve http / C:\, and then browsing to the local HTTP endpoint.
The issue can also occur on Linux if the local administrator enabled an operator
user ID with tailscale up --operator&#x3D;$USER, as the $USER account could
serve itself files that it could not normally read.
Who is affected?
Owners of Windows deployments for which the users of Tailscale nodes do not also
have OS-level administrative access, and owners of Linux deployments where the
administrator enabled non-root --operator access.
This issue can only be triggered by a local user and cannot be triggered
remotely.
What is the impact?
This issue enables local privilege escalation (file read access). Access to
certain system files (such as /etc/shadow on Linux) can then be used to obtain
full administrative control over the host.
What do I need to do?
On Windows 10 and later, upgrade to Tailscale 1.52 (released 30 October
2023) or later, which resolves the issue.
On Windows 7 and 8, upgrade to Tailscale 1.44.3 (released 8 Jan
2024), which resolves the issue.
On Linux, upgrade to 1.54 (released 15 November 2023) or later,
which resolves the issue.
The best practice is to run the latest stable version, which as of this writing
is 1.56.1. Consider turning on automatic updates.
Use Tailscale ACLs to control the availability of Funnel.</span>

Resolved - From 10:30 to 16:15 UTC on January 3rd, our &#x60;/settings/emails&#x60; page experienced downtime due to an outage in our contact permissions system. During this time customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences.
