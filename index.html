                              <span>Issue summary:

From 12:20pm PST until 3:00pm PST on January 22, 2024, some Enterprise Grid users noticed multiple Slackbot responses being triggered unexpectedly.


We determined that the rollout of a fix for an older bug report pertaining to Slackbot responses not working in org-wide or multi-workspace channels, was the root cause. 


Whilst the fix for the bug was intended to improve this features behaviour, ensuring that Slackbot custom responses would work in these channel types, our wider team concluded that the fixed behaviour might not function well for organizations with potentially thousands of custom Slackbot responses.


We rolled back the deployment which caused this behaviour. Customers will no longer see these Slackbot custom responses being triggered unexpectedly.


A discussion is underway about the long-term future of Slackbot custom response behaviour within large organizations.


Thank you for your patience whilst we resolved this.</span>

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 at 3:38 UTC, we experienced an incident that affected customers using Codespaces. Customers encountered issues creating and resuming Codespaces in multiple regions due to operational issues with compute and storage resources.
Around 25% of customers were impacted, primarily in East US and West Europe. We re-routed traffic for Codespace creations to less impacted regions, but existing Codespaces in these regions may have been unable to resume during the incident.
By 7:30 UTC, we had recovered connectivity to all regions except West Europe, which had an extended recovery time due to increased load in that particular region. The incident was resolved on 2024-01-21 at 9:34 UTC once Codespace creations and resumes were working normally in all regions.

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 from 02:05 UTC to 06:19 UTC, GitHub Hosted Runners experienced increased error rates from our main cloud service provider. The errors were initially limited to a single region and we were able to route around the issue by transparently failing over to other regions. However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.
During the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.
We’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.
Jan 21, 05:54 UTC
Update - We&#x27;ve applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.
Jan 21, 05:26 UTC
Update - We have mitigated the issues impacting Actions Larger Runners. We are still experiencing delays starting normal jobs, and are continuing to investigate.
Jan 21, 04:53 UTC
Update - The team has identified the cause of the issues with Actions Larger Runners and has begun mitigation.
Jan 21, 04:16 UTC
Update - The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time and a percentage of jobs failing. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.
Jan 21, 03:45 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

Your keys are tagged and logged into the system for real-time tracking.
Staff at the Point securely stores your keys.
Send the location of the key and the code to your guests within your automated Smily messages.
Guests or cleaners visit the Point, show their safety code, and receive the key.
Upon return, they drop the key back at the same Point, and you are notified.

From 11:26 AM PST on January 12, 2024 to 10:04 AM PST on January 15, 2024, some users were unable to configure 2FA on their accounts. We were made aware of this after a spike in reports early in the morning of Monday, January 15.


Upon investigation, this issue was traced back to a recent code change which we discovered was preventing users from being redirected back to the 2FA configuration page after entering their password during the 2FA setup process. We immediately reverted this change which fully resolved the issue.</span>

Users saw increased error rates and latency for event processing, accessing our Cloud Control Panel/API, applying Cloud Firewall policies, accessing www.digitalocean.com and our Community site, and DNS resolution. Additionally, users saw timeouts/increased latency for networking requests to Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as connections to existing App Platform Apps.

Improvement
  
We&#x27;re thrilled to share a new feature we’ve just released for booking.com properties.
What&#x27;s New?
The rate rule Booking at least &#x27;x&#x27; day ahead is now synchronised on booking.com channel;
Why Does This Matter?
You were facing the obstacle where Guests were making a booking for the same day or &#x27;x&#x27; days (based on your settings) even though the setting to prevent that was activated;
-&gt; It won’t happen anymore.
What&#x27;s Next?
If you face any obstacle with this setting, reach out to us; 
We are and will be working on more improvements to make your day-to-day easier :)

Resolved - On January 9 between 12:45 and 13:56 UTC, services in one of our three sites experienced elevated latency for connections.  This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in c…</span>

Resolved - On January 9 between 1:06 and 5:43 UTC, no audit log events were streamed for customers that have that enabled. All events that happened during this time were delivered after the issue was mitigated. The event delivery was failing due to a data shape issue, with a streaming configuration linked to a soft-deleted Enterprise causing a runtime error for a backend service.  This was mitigated by removing that configuration.  Since the incident, we have improved our detection of these errors and ensured support for similar scenarios.
Jan  9, 05:40 UTC
Update - Audit logs streaming is currently unavailable due to a misconfiguration issue. The root cause is understood and our engineers will be updating the broken configuration shortly.
Jan  9, 04:59 UTC
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

Resolved - From January 5th to January 8th, Codespaces experienced issues with port forwarding when connecting from a web browser. During this incident 100% of operations to forward ports and connect to a forwarded port failed for customers located in US West and Australia. The cause was due to a cross origin API change in our port forwarding service. After detecting the issue, we mitigated the impact by rolling back the change that caused the discrepancy in the cross origin rules. We have improved the way we are detecting issues like this one including implementing automated alerts during and after the rollout process so that we get signals as early as possible.
Jan  8, 22:37 UTC
Update - The initial mitigation we attempted did not fully resolve this issue.  We are continuing to investigate and will provide an update as soon as possible.
Jan  8, 21:55 UTC
Update - We are engaged on the issue and continuing to work toward a mitigation. Please continue to fallback to VS Code desktop for port forwarding workflows.
Jan  8, 21:03 UTC
Update - Mitigation of degraded Codespaces port forwarding in is progress.  In the meantime, please continue to use VS Code Desktop for port forwarding.
Jan  8, 20:22 UTC
Update - We are actively mitigating degraded performance of Codespaces port forwarding in the web and GitHub CLI.  Codespaces port forwarding on VS Code Desktop is unaffected.

Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Codespaces</span>

                              <span>Description: On Windows before Tailscale version 1.52 and on Linux before
Tailscale 1.54, the tailscale serve and tailscale funnel features allowed
users to serve the contents of directories that their user account could not
access, but which the tailscaled service process could.
What happened?
A user could escalate their own file read access by running, for example,
tailscale.exe serve http / C:\, and then browsing to the local HTTP endpoint.
The issue can also occur on Linux if the local administrator enabled an operator
user ID with tailscale up --operator&#x3D;$USER, as the $USER account could
serve itself files that it could not normally read.
Who is affected?
Owners of Windows deployments for which the users of Tailscale nodes do not also
have OS-level administrative access, and owners of Linux deployments where the
administrator enabled non-root --operator access.
This issue can only be triggered by a local user and cannot be triggered
remotely.
What is the impact?
This issue enables local privilege escalation (file read access). Access to
certain system files (such as /etc/shadow on Linux) can then be used to obtain
full administrative control over the host.
What do I need to do?
On Windows 10 and later, upgrade to Tailscale 1.52 (released 30 October
2023) or later, which resolves the issue.
On Windows 7 and 8, upgrade to Tailscale 1.44.3 (released 8 Jan
2024), which resolves the issue.
On Linux, upgrade to 1.54 (released 15 November 2023) or later,
which resolves the issue.
The best practice is to run the latest stable version, which as of this writing
is 1.56.1. Consider turning on automatic updates.
Use Tailscale ACLs to control the availability of Funnel.</span>

Resolved - From 10:30 to 16:15 UTC on January 3rd, our &#x60;/settings/emails&#x60; page experienced downtime due to an outage in our contact permissions system. During this time customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences.

Unfortunately, the outage prevented the generation of links for managing email subscriptions, resulting in the &#x60;/settings/emails&#x60; page timing out. Consequently, customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences during this period.
During the incident we implemented graceful degradation on the &#x60;/settings/email&#x60; page to enable certain functionality, albeit with slower response time…</span>

Resolved - On December 26, 2023, GitHub received a report through our Bug Bounty Program demonstrating a vulnerability which, if exploited, allowed access to credentials within a production container. We fixed this vulnerability on GitHub.com the same day and began rotating all potentially exposed credentials. Through this process we found some flaws in how we rotate certain credentials and are working on improving our credential rotation process.
