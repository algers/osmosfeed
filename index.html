  We&#x27;re investigating reports of an issue with Google Meet. We will provide more information shortly.  The affected users are able to access Google Meet, but are seeing error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior.
 We are experiencing an issue with Google Meet Livestreams beginning at Tuesday, 2022-12-12 22:57
US/Pacific.
Google engineers are continuing to work on localizing issue for Google meet livestreams. The issue does not impact iOS users of Meet.
We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2022-12-13 10:00 US/Pacific with current details.
We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.
 
Users were unable to start a livestream on Google Meet. Livestreams of meetings created during the outage did not work. However, those that are created before the start of the issue (2022-12-12 23:00 PST) and created after mitigation time (2022-12-13 09:22 PST) should have worked.

From December 8, 2022 at 03:15 PST to December 8, 2022 at 05:10 PST, some customers may have experienced issues with exports failing. This was due to a lack of disk space on one of the hosts running export jobs. We fixed this issue by terminating the host which resolved the problem for all affected customers.</span>

On December 4, 2022, from 5:00 PM PST to 11:14 PM, users ran into trouble where they did not receive 2FA codes on SMS, making them unable to log into Slack as a result. This issue was due to a service provider&#x27;s slow processing rate.


To fix this, we sorted out the processing backlog together with the service provider. We then had them raise the country specific processing rate limit, resolving the issue for our customers.</span>

An automation from an upstream DNS service accidentally blocked slack.com queries in a limited region (mostly the Northeast US). 


After communication with the upstream provider, the issue was identified and corrected. Impacted users should have no further issues connecting to Slack.</span>

From November 23, 2022 at 7:30pm PST to November 23, 2022 at 8:22pm PST, some users were unable to send messages, load content or use workflows within Slack. We discovered the issue was related to a recent change which accidentally severed access to a number of endpoints. A network change was made and most services started to auto-recover and work again. 


During the restore process some users experienced search errors or slow responses within the search bar. This was resolved on November 24, 2022 at 5:58pm PST, restoring functionality for all affected users.</span>

Severity: Critical
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon tailscaled, which can then be used to remotely execute code.
Affected platforms: Windows
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.
Who is affected?
All Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.
Reviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.

Severity: Low
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access Tailscale environment variables.
Affected platforms: All
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.
Who is affected?
All Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.
An attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.
There is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.
