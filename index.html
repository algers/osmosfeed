Update - We have now completed our investigation and identified that the issue affected a small percentage of Make users and their organizations. We are preparing to update all impacted customers with information about the scenarios and particular executions that may have produced incorrect data in the Data Store. We expect to update all impacted customers in the next 24 hours.
Sep 20, 14:50 CEST
Update - We have confirmed that this issue did not impact private and OEM instances. We are currently working to identify all affected customers in Make multi-tenant zones (eu1.make.com, eu2.make.com, eu1.make.celonis.com, us1.make.com, us1.make.celonis.com). Once we have identified these customers, we will contact them and post an update here to explain the issue and any ongoing impact. We will share the next update as soon as we can.
Sep 20, 12:10 CEST
Update - We are currently in the process of locating impacted scenarios. Once the full list is obtained further communications will be sent.
Sep 19, 14:30 CEST
Update - We have identified an issue with the &quot;Update a Record&quot; module in the Data store app. In the period of September 18th 7:16pm CET until September 19th 12:00pm, the module might have produced incorrect output and data store records that were updated during this period may have been incorrectly stored (only the updated values for a given record were stored while other values were cleared). We are investigating the scope of impact and will provide more information in the next update.
Sep 19, 11:14 CEST
Identified - The issue has been identified and a fix has been implemented. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.
Sep 19, 10:16 CEST
Investigating - &quot;We have detected an issue specifically with the &#x27;Update a Record&#x27; module in the datastore app. For the time being, we kindly request that you refrain from using scenarios associated with this module until the matter is resolved. Thank you for your understanding and patience.&quot;</span>

From September 6, 2023 at 9:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 3:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.</span>

Resolved - From 6:25pm PDT - 6:46pm PDT, we experienced an issue that prevented users from accessing Notion. The issue has been resolved, so users should be able to access Notion again. We&#x27;ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we experience other issues.
Root cause: 
One of our memcache clusters crashed and caused our API cluster to get stuck. Engineering resolved the issue by restarting them. We’ll continue to investigate on what caused the cluster to crash.</span>

From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.</span>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…</span>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…</span>

From 11:00 PM PDT on September 1, 2023 to 01:00 AM PDT on September 2, 2023, some users in India may have had issues with the messaging functionality in Slack.


We determined that the issue was caused by too many requests causing our database to be overwhelmed.


To resolve the issue, we created additional hosts and redistributed the requests which fixed the issue for affected users. 


Thank you for your patience while we sorted this out.</span>

On August 23, 2023 from 4:30 PM PDT to August 31, 2023 11:26 PM PDT, some users experienced an issue posting messages in the designated #general channel of their workspace. 


Our team identified that recent changes in our code broke some conditional logic and deprecated the preference that allows users to post in the #general channel.


We pushed out a fix and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue.</span>

From 11:32 PM PDT on August 29, 2023 to 02:06 AM PDT on August 30, 2023, some users may have seen an internal server or connection error in workflow and app modals.


We determined that a code change inadvertently caused an issue where incorrect data was stored in our database. When a modal was opened it used this incorrect data and displayed a connection error to users.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On August 28, 2023 from 4:30 AM PDT to 10:30 AM PDT, less than 1% of Slack users encountered slowness when loading channels, DMs, and threads. Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.


We found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. 


We restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. 


We&#x27;re continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.</span>

On August 24, 2023 between 10:41 AM PDT to 4:10 PM PDT, channel sections were missing from some users&#x27; sidebars.


We determined that a recent update in code failed to process an older format of data objects coming from our cache.


While we reverted this change and saw the majority of the issue resolved, this action caused an issue localized to the new data format and some users were still affected. 


Once we pushed a fix to normalize and handle all objects in the cache, channel sections were restored for all impacted users.</span>

Beginning August 16th 2023 at 11:00 AM PDT, some Android users signing into the Slack via Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Edge, saw the error &quot;For reasons unknown, we were unable to sign you into your workspace&quot; or &quot;Drat, your login didn&#x27;t work&quot;.


We found the error is related to a web redirect issue with Slack and Microsoft Edge. 


We&#x27;ll work to fix this internally through a bug ticket that has been filed as a result of this incident. Though we haven&#x27;t resolved this issue yet, we will provide further updates through customer support tickets with the impacted users.</span>
