From Monday December 12, 2022 at 10:27 AM PST to Monday December 19, 2022 at 1:30 PM PST, we began investigating reports of messages being marked as read when backgrounding the iOS app while in a conversation. As a result, the sidebar would not show unread messages next to the DM/Channel/Threads view. 


We have now made a change on our end that resolved the issue and released a fix on iOS app version 22.12.21. Users on the iOS app should now be able to receive messages without them being marked as read automatically.</span>

At Smily, we are here to help you Save time and Book more! That&#x27;s why we are always thrilled to announce new features 🎉
Over the past few years, more and more channels have allowed you to set the check-in instructions, to coordinate a smooth and seamless arrival with your guests.
The check-in types were not synchronized with Smily, preventing you from adding this critical information to your listings.
After several requests and feedback, we created a new field on the rental base where you can add your check-in type. 

This feature is now synchronized with your website and our top partners, Airbnb, Booking.com, VRBO, and Expedia.
Add your check-in types in Smily and provide your guests with a smoother check-in experience!
For more details please follow the steps in this article
We invite you to discover all these new features, and we hope it will help you manage better your bookings, save time, and book more!
Wishing you all a pleasant day!</span>
