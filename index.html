Resolved - From 10:59 UTC to 13:48 UTC, GitHub Codespaces service was down or degraded due to an outage in our authentication service.This issue impacted 67% of users over this time period.
Our service auth layer experienced throttling with our third party dependencies due to higher load. This impacted all user facing scenarios for Codespaces service. Our automated regional failover kicked in, but it failed to mitigate as this issue impacted the service globally. We mitigated manually by reducing load on external dependency.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess and implement scaling improvements to make our service more resilient with increasing load.
Oct 17, 13:46 UTC
Update - Codespaces is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.
Oct 17, 13:24 UTC
Update - We are continuing with efforts to mitigate Codespaces issues   and are beginning to see some Codespace creations succeed.
Oct 17, 12:18 UTC
Update - We have identified an issue impacting most Codespaces operations and are working on a mitigation.
Oct 17, 11:18 UTC
Update - Codespaces is experiencing degraded availability. We are continuing to investigate.
Oct 17, 11:14 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Codespaces</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the resolution of the issue that impacted the Spaces CDN. Objects should be accessible over the CDN endpoint without any issues. However, HTTP/2 is temporarily unavailable due to upstream issues, and due to this HTTP/2 requests should automatically be re-negotiated to 1.1, but in case you experience failures please open a ticket with our support team.
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.
Oct 12, 16:10 UTC
Update - After our upstream provider implemented a remediation step to resolve the issue with the Spaces CDN, the Spaces CDN is serving the objects stored in the Spaces bucket without any errors or performance issues. However, we are still monitoring the situation closely and we&#x27;ll share more in…</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has resolved the issue with the Managed Kubernetes Service. A daemonset has been released to all existing clusters eliminating the auto-update process and it will be removed again going forward. If you find worker nodes that could still be affected by a prior occurrence of this incident, please replace them for permanent mitigation.
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Resolved - On October 9, 2023 at 14:24 UTC, a noticeable delay in commits appearing in pull requests was detected.  During the incident, approximately 9% of pull requests (less than the 20% first reported) experienced staleness of up to 7m. The root cause was identified to be an increase in the latency of a downstream dependency causing pull request workers to saturate their available capacity, resulting in delayed updates to PRs - no data was lost during this incident.
	We mitigated this by adding additional capacity to the affected worker pool at 15:02 UTC. This allowed our background jobs to catch up with the backlog of updates and provide relief to our customers. Additionally, we have significantly increased the performance of the downstream service to prevent recurrence
Oct  9, 14:52 UTC
Update - We are investigating delays for commits showing up on Pull Requests page loads in the web UI. As a result of this,  about 20% of pull requests are currently showing stale data of up-to 7m. We are currently investigating contributing factors right now.

On Friday, October 6 2023, from 1:52 AM PDT to 2:12 AM PDT, some users were unable to load Slack. This was caused by an issue where certain backend Slack processes were pulling data from our database rather than their cache which caused strain on our servers.


We rolled out a change to how these processes load data, and the issue was resolved for all users.</span>

Resolved - We deployed a new configuration to improve our network availability. This resulted in a small percentage of user traffic getting incorrectly blocked, but missed by our automated detections. We mitigated this with a change to the configuration, rolled out slowly over the last hour of this incident time for safe deployment. Beyond the learnings related to the config, we are analyzing how we can more quickly detect this kind of impact as part of future configuration rollouts.
Oct  6, 02:42 UTC
Update - We have confirmed that the fix has resolved the issue in the subset of regions where it has been deployed. We are now continuing the deployment to the remaining regions.
Oct  6, 02:03 UTC
Update - We are monitoring the rollout of the fix and are beginning to see signs of improvement. We will send another update shortly.
Oct  6, 01:31 UTC
Update - A small number of customers are experiencing 403 errors when attempting to access repository data via the API. We have found what we believe to be the cause of the issue and are deploying a fix.
Oct  6, 01:12 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for API Requests</span>

Resolved - On October 5, 2023 at 13:40 UTC, our monitoring systems observed an increase in the time it was taking for Git pushes to become visible when viewing commits in Pull Requests. Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.

On Oct 4, 2023 from 11:15 PM PDT to around 11:58 PM PDT a small subset of users experienced trouble connecting to Slack and sending and receiving messages.


A code change optimizing resource usage caused a core service to restart causing brief connectivity issues for a few users.


The service recovered automatically and we’ve put measures in place to prevent this from happening in the future.</span>

On October 2, 2023 from 12:18PM PDT to 12:26PM PDT, some users noticed that threads were not loading correctly.


We identified a database issue on our backend that was causing the threads to not load. The issue was mitigated and users should no longer experience trouble loading threads.


We are investigating the cause of the database issue so we can ensure this does not happen again.


We apologize for any interruption to your work day!</span>

Resolved - From 14:44 UTC to 18:04 UTC we experienced another issue with our App Platform service related to CDN Insights for Apps in all regions. During this window, users might have observed blank graphs or no data for the CDN metrics including request counts, cache hit rates etc. Our engineering team was able to identify the problem and resolve it fully and as of 18:04 UTC all the metrics are displaying properly. 
The connectivity issue with the Apps for which we updated the status page earlier was only faced by a subset of users in FRA1 region, only between 12:45 UTC to 14:15 UTC. The normal functionality of apps was entirely restored around 14:15 UTC.
Thank you for your patience on this and if you continue to face issues then please open a support ticket from within the cloud control panel.</span>

On September 28, 2023 from approximately 11:54 AM PDT to 3:15 PM PDT, some Slack users experienced trouble receiving two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and therefore were unable to sign into Slack.


We determined this was caused by an upstream 2FA provider issue impacting code deliveries to US-based AT&amp;T and Verizon devices. We monitored communications from the provider and confirmed Slack users could successfully sign in once the upstream issue was resolved.</span>

From 8:00 AM PDT to 11:00 AM PDT on Thursday, September 28, 2023, a small number of users experienced delays in Slack, including sending and editing messages, and loading channels.


Upon investigation, we determined that a specific task in our backend was producing too many file deletion events and overloading our servers, resulting in these delays.


We implemented a fix to reduce the load on our servers and this resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

On September 27, 2023 from 9:01 AM PDT to 12:32 PM PDT, some users experienced issues when attempting to create or edit custom apps on https://api.slack.com/apps, including seeing a &quot;404 error&quot; on this website.


We traced this back to a recent change that removed a function necessary for rendering a documentation page associated with the website. 


We reverted the change, restoring the documentation page rendering component on https://api.slack.com/apps. Users should no longer have issues creating or editing custom apps and accessing this website.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

On September 26, 2023 from 10:00 AM PDT to 12:00 PM PDT, some users on our new interface design couldn&#x27;t dismiss an information prompt that read &quot;You now have Later&quot;. 


These users also experienced their UI locking, and were unable to click anything in the Slack app. For some, the sparkle animation fixed over the Later icon in the sidebar also persisted longer than intended. 


We identified the root cause as a missing detail in a recent code change. We reverted the change to mitigate the immediate issue, then deployed a fix to fully resolve the problem for all impacted users.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

Resolved - On September 27, 2023 at 00:12 UTC, our alerting systems detected an increase in the time it took GitHub Actions workflow runs to start. During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.
	We mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC. We have additional repair items in place to prevent a recurrence in the future.

Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

                              <span>Issue summary: 

From 12:54 PM PDT on September 22, 2023 to 09:13 AM PDT on September 25, 2023, custom emoji rendered as text for a small number of Enterprise Grid users.


We made a code change that inadvertently introduced unnecessary logging for routine emoji events. This unexpected logging increased traffic to the custom emoji infrastructure, impacting its performance. 


We deployed a fix to remove the unnecessary logging, which reduced traffic to the custom emoji systems and restored normal emoji rendering. 


A small fraction of the affected customers may have experienced lingering issues as the fix was gradually rolled out to everyone.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On September 21, 2023 from 8:00 PM PDT to 1:30 PM PDT, some users encountered a message stating &quot;Something went wrong&quot; when accessing the Slack Connect invites page.


We determined that rate limits set for querying invites were the cause of the &quot;Something went wrong&quot; message. These limits were set prior to the  product decision to include these in the Activity view. Because use of this view has increased, the limits are reached much sooner than originally expected.


These limits were lifted for the invites page, resolving the issue for users. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>
