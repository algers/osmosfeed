From July 26th, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT to July 28th 2023 at 1:00PM PDT some users had trouble loading and editing canvases when accessing them from the channel canvas icon.


We determined this issue was caused by a recent code change related to how canvases persist across sessions. We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users. To see the fix applied, user impacted users should press Command/Control + R. We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.</span>

Resolved - [False alarm] This incident was a false alarm—the LOS Records API is working as expected. Apologies for the inconvenience.
Jul 28, 10:02 PDT
Identified - Starting today (July 28, 2023), we identified an issue affecting the LOS Records API. Records for 180 days from today (beyond Jan 24, 2024) are being ignored, and the dates are marked as unavailable on Airbnb, although requests to set those records are not failing. We are actively working to find the root cause, and mitigate this issue. We will post more information as soon as possible.</span>

On July 27, 2023 between 2:03 AM PDT - 2:59 AM PDT, Slack was experiencing a systemwide issue during which users were not able to send or receive messages across multiple platforms. 


Our engineering team identified an issue after a change was made to a service that manages our internal system communication. This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. 


We are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future. More information about remediation and prevention steps will be included in an upcoming RCA which you can request by writing into feedback@slack.com.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jul 27, 01:02 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jul 26, 23:08 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-27 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-27 05:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavour to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 24 July 2023 at 07:50
Incident End: 26 July 2023 at 04:15
Duration: 1 day, 20 hours, 25 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Google Classroom
Regions/Zones: Global
Description:
Google Classroom experienced an issue where the Classroom iOS app crashed for users when they attempted to access any course page following an update of the app. From preliminary analysis, the root cause was an issue that caused a migration of the app&#x27;s local database to fail, resulting in crashes for all users upgrading the application.
Our engineers withdrew the problematic app update and released a new app update with the fix.
Affected users should update their apps to the latest version available on the iOS app store for the fix.
Customer Impact:
Less than two percent of Daily Active Users for Classroom iOS  experienced app crashes when they attempted to access any course page following an update of the app.
Users that freshly installed the Classroom iOS app were not impacted by the issue.

Affected products: Classroom</span>

On July 25th, 2023 from 3:00 PM PDT to 6:00 PM PDT we received reports of existing members unable to invite new members to workspaces. We traced the cause of issue to a recent code change which prevented emails from being sent. This also impacted logins, workspace creation and potentially other email-based processes.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jul 26, 01:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jul 25, 23:09 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-26 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-26 05:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase. 
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

On July 13, 2023 between 12:19 PM PDT and 12:36 PM PDT, some users encountered errors which led to being unable to load threads, send DMs, joining channels, and accessing Slack overall.


This issue was a result of a failed host in our database infrastructure. We quickly replaced this host, fixing the problem for all impacted users.


Users should no longer be experiencing any trouble accessing Slack.</span>

Resolved - We have backfilled message threads for the reservations that were affected during this time window. You should now be able to retrieve the &#x60;thread_id&#x60; associated with a reservation using the Reservations API. Apologies for the inconvenience.
If you have any further queries related to this incident, please submit a ticket via the Partner Support Portal and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
Jul 12, 12:25 PDT
Identified - We have identified an issue that caused reservations to be created without associated threads. This occurred between 10:15 PM and 11:29 PM on July 12th (PST), so notifications for reservations created during that time were sent with a null &#x60;thread_id&#x60; value.
We are actively working on creating threads for reservations that do not have them, and will update here afterwards.
Once this is done, you will be able to retrieve the &#x60;thread_id&#x60; value for a reservation using the Reservations API.</span>

Hello, 
During the above window, our Engineering team will be performing maintenance on redundant upstream electrical systems in order to improve reliability in our FRA1 region.
Expected Impact:
We don&#x27;t expect to see any downtime as the power to hypervisors are redundant. In a highly unlikely situation, where we lose power to both the supplies, the Droplets in FRA1 may experience downtime for a brief period. We will endeavor to keep this to a minimum for the duration of the change.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket
Thank you,
