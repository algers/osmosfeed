Sounds impossible to find a guest message in seconds ? 
As we keep improving our features, we work closely with property users and managers like yourself to learn how we can help you run your business more efficiently. 
After several workshops, reflections, and feedback, our Smily team did several adjustments to help you use our centralized Inbox in order to simplify this daily communication.
We added several filters to help you find the conversations easily in the Inbox, you can now filter by the following criterias:
Conversation status
Assignee
Guest
Booking stage
Booking status
Rental
Booking tag
Rental tag

This way you can find the exact conversation you are looking for in a matter of seconds :)

On January 31, 2023 from 11:40 AM PST to 11:55 AM PST, customers may have experienced issues with workflows not running as expected or posting duplicate messages. 


A network event prevented access to some of the database servers that support workflows. This disruption meant that the remaining servers were unable to handle the workflow load. 


We restarted the affected servers and manually increased the capacity to resolve the issue, restoring normal workflow behaviour.</span>

On January 31, 2023 from 9:44 AM to 3:17 PM PST, some customers may have experienced issues creating new workspaces. 


An error in our onboarding flow meant we were incorrectly assuming new workspaces had completed the onboarding process before any onboarding actually took place, leaving these newly created workspaces in an unusable limbo state. We reverted the change that caused the initial onboarding inconsistencies, then released a fix to resolve some dependencies from the reverted file. 


Everyone should be able to create new workspaces as normal once again, although you may experience some overzealous onboarding prompts as the system resolves any lingering inconsistencies.</span>

On January 24, 2023, from 5:50 AM to 9:30 AM PST, some customers experienced errors when opening threads and saw blank channels and direct message histories.


We traced this issue to an unexpected spike in a database load. We made a configuration change that restored full functionality to threads and conversations for all impacted users.


We are investigating ways to prevent this from occurring in the future.


You may need to reload Slack (Command/Ctrl + Shift + R) in order for the fix to be reflected on your end. We&#x27;re sorry for the disruption we brought to your day.</span>

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed nodes with expired node keys to continue communicating with other nodes in a tailnet.
What happened?
There was a flaw in Tailscale’s logic for expiring node keys. If the set of nodes that can connect in a tailnet (the netmap) didn’t have any changes, then expired node keys were not immediately removed from the netmap. The longest delay in removal was 19 days, from 2022-12-20 to 2023-01-09.
Who is affected?
All tailnets with nodes whose node keys expired prior to 2023-01-12 may have been affected. Admins of a tailnet can view nodes with expired node keys in the admin console.
What is the impact?
Connections between nodes could continue after a node key expired, both when the expired node key was the source or when it was the destination of a connection. Connections to nodes with expired node keys would only be possible if they met all of the following criteria:
The peer node was in the same tailnet as, or shared into a tailnet with the node with the expired node key;
The peer node and the node with the expired node key were allowed to connect based on the access rules in the tailnet policy file at the time of expiry of the node key;
The tailnet’s netmap, including access rules, nodes added or removed from the tailnet, or connectivity of nodes in the tailnet did not change since the node key expiry; and
Tailscale had not deployed a change to the coordination server since the node key expiry.
What do I need to do?
No action is required. Tailscale has deployed a fix to the coordination server as of 2023-01-11.
Upgrade clients to v1.36 or later for an additional mitigation. In conjunction with the coordination server fix, this mitigation prevents nodes from connecting to nodes with expired node keys if the Tailscale coordination server is offline or unreachable.

From January 16th, 2023 04:59 to 08:38 AM PST, some users experienced issues creating Posts, using workflows, and trouble accessing Slack.  


We traced this back to an issue with our internal DNS configuration. Once this was identified and resolved, functionality was restored to all impacted users.</span>

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed a malicious individual to share nodes from other tailnets to themselves, if they knew the node ID of the target.
What happened?
A bug in Tailscale’s node sharing logic allowed the creation of sharing invitations by unauthorized users. A malicious individual who knew a target node’s database ID could generate and accept a sharing invite for that node without being an admin of the target node’s tailnet.
This was possible for any node in any tailnet, as long as the individual knew the target’s node ID. The node ID is an integer used in the admin panel’s database, and is not related to the node “StableID” that is visible to Tailscale clients. A node’s ID is only visible in the API or admin console, by admins of either the node’s tailnet or a tailnet to which that node has already been shared. IDs are random 64-bit numbers that are not sequential or otherwise easily guessable.
The bug was introduced on 2022-09-14, reported to us on 2023-01-11, and remediated on 2023-01-12.
Who is affected?
All tailnets with nodes are affected.
What is the impact?
This vulnerability was not triggered or exploited. Analysis of tailnet logs shows that no unauthorized shares were created or accepted while the vulnerability was present, except as part of the proof of concept from the individual who reported the vulnerability.
Admins of a tailnet can review nodes that are shared out of their tailnet in the admin console. Sharing invites are logged as events in configuration audit logs. Admins can also review invites created and accepted in their configuration audit logs in the admin console.
What do I need to do?
No action is required. Tailscale has deployed a fix to the coordination server as of 2023-01-12, and verified that the vulnerability was not exploited.
