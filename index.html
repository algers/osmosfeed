                              <span>New!
  
Today, we are glad to announce yet a new feature: a brand new Dashboard section that will allow you to easily manage your daily tasks, directly from your Smily account.
Here is a sneak peek at what the new Dashboard looks like:

In the past, managing day to day operations may have been complicated. Tasks such as keeping track of payments, approving pending tentatives and others were time consuming.
Thanks to the Dashboard, you now have access to the following information:
List of pending tentatives: to help you convert them into confirmed bookings, or cancel them to free up the dates in your calendar
List of bookings with missing payments: to help you get all your payments on time and never miss a payment again
List of arrivals of the day: to help you plan the check-in of your guests
List of departures of the day: to help you plan the check-out of your guests
You can find more details in the dedicated manual article, and a video guided tour of the new Dashboard section will soon be added there as well.
We invite you to explore this new Dashboard, and hope it will help you save time and better manage your daily operations. Some improvements will also be made in the future, such as adding performance metrics to help you manage your business more easily.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has observed mitigated impact for this issue, due to actions taken upstream. Users should no longer experience any network latency/packet loss on Droplets and Droplet-based services from SGP to the EU region. App Platform health checks should now pass as expected.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please send us a ticket from your Cloud support page.
Aug 10, 04:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug 10, 03:59 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2022-08-10 04:00 UTC
End: 2022-08-10 08:00 UTC 
During the above window, we will be performing maintenance in our TOR1 region as part of network upgrades.
Expected Impact:
During this period, inbound and outbound traffic between TOR1 and the rest of the DO network may experience a couple of brief (5-10 second) interruptions as traffic is isolated from each TOR1 core switch prior to being upgraded. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please send us a ticket from your Cloud support page.</span>
