Resolved - Our engineering team has identified the the root cause of the service restart to be a side effect of an internal tool used for capturing packet traces to help support customers. We have suspended use of this tool until a fix for this issue is deployed. There should not be anymore connectivity interruptions for Super SIM.
May 11, 12:17 PDT
Update - At 11:13 AM PST, approximately 4% of data sessions connected through the super or us1.super APNs were dropped causing devices to disconnect. This was due to one of the services responsible for routing data traffic between devices and the internet restarting unexpectedly. Devices that lost connectivity should have been able to immediately reconnect to one of the other instances of the same service. The impacted service was recovered within 30 seconds and resumed handling traffic. This issue was not a result of any issues at our downstream connectivity partners.
Our engineering team has been alerted and is actively investigating. We will update in 1 hour or as soon as we have additional information.

Mini Incident Report
We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support  or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.
(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 5 May 2023 12:02
Incident End: 5 May 2023 12:58
Duration: 56 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Gmail, Google Cloud Networking
Regions/Zones: Multi Region Europe
Description:
Multiple Google services, including GCP and Workspace, experienced an outage for a duration of up to 56 minutes in and around Spain/Morocco. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a Google initiated network routing change at the edge of our network there. The issue was mitigated at 12:58 by removing the problematic routers from service, forcing traffic to use other paths.
Customer Impact:
GCP
Google Cloud Networking experienced a full outage for all internet service providers (ISPs) connected to two peering routers in Madrid, Spain.
All GCP services were unavailable for users reaching GCP from impacted ISP(s) until mitigation in and around Spain/Morocco.
Workspace
Some Gmail customers had delivery delays and availability issues during the outage in Spain.
If your service or application was affected, we apologize — this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have taken and are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.

Resolved - Impact: minor;
Our upstream provider will continue to work to fully resolve this issue, but at this time, we have not been provided an ETA. Until we receive communication from them, traffic will remain shifted away to alternate providers to mitigate user impact. 
Due to this, we will go ahead and close out this incident. The traffic shift to reintroduce upstream providers, when it occurs, should be seamless for users in the SFO regions. 
If you have any questions or concerns about this or continue to experience network connectivity issues, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
Reports show that from approximately 20:00 UTC on May 8th to 02:30 UTC on May 9th, DNS resolution was inoperative for services in our SFO1 region. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel.
Resolved: May 09, 2023 - 03:42 UTC
-
Our Engineering team identified an issue with the path that resolver traffic was taking for our SFO1 region, resulting in services in SFO1 being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. A fix has been put in place and we&#x27;ve confirmed that DNS resolution is now functioning normally.
We&#x27;re now monitoring the situation and will post an update shortly once we confirm full resolution of this incident.
Monitoring: May 09, 2023 - 02:49 UTC
-
Our Engineering team is investigating user reports of services in our SFO1 region being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. This includes running commands on Droplets that utilize DNS lookups, such as &quot;wget&quot; and &quot;apt update&quot;, etc. Inbound network connections to services should still be operating normally. 
Thank you for your patience as our team works to understand the root cause of the issue. We&#x27;ll post an update once we have further information.
Investigating: May 09, 2023 - 02:06 UTC

Resolved - Our Engineering team has continued to actively monitor the situation resulting from multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. Over the last ten days, network connectivity on routes from Singapore to San Francisco and Singapore to Europe has not experienced any major packet loss or latency.

Crews have been able to complete some cable repairs, leading to the stability for the routes mentioned. 
Our team is still observing daily packet loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and New York City, as well as Singapore and Toronto. These are normally short-lived and happen during Singapore business hours when traffic is heavy.

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device
reauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to
lose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.
What happened?
The logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an
already-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the
device’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s
identity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without
any tags.
The bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on
2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.
Who is affected?
189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either
directly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast
user switching to switch between multiple
tailnets.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security
contacts.
What is the impact?
Devices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the
device’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,
or the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the
device. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab
of the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this
could change the device’s network permissions.
We have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of
deliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect
outcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.
What do I need to do?
If you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were
contacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the
admin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix
to the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected
organizations.</span>

Resolved - Impact: none;
Our Engineering team identified an issue impacting Spaces availability in our NYC3 region from 18:00 - 18:10 UTC. During that time, all requests to Spaces buckets in NYC3 failed and users may have seen connection timeouts or other errors. Users attempting to create new Spaces buckets via the Cloud Control Panel or Spaces API would have also experienced errors. 
Our team identified the issue and performed an immediate rollback, mitigating the situation. As of 18:10 UTC, all requests and bucket creations were succeeding once more.
We apologize for the delayed notice and disruption in service. If you have any questions or concerns, please open a support ticket from within your account.

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On April 20th, 2023 from 6:00 AM PDT until 7:45 AM PDT, a small number of users experienced latency issues when using Slack. Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. 


The issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. 


Our team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.

We are happy to announce that new damage deposit payment settings are now available in your Smily account. Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.
Why the changes?
Up until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings &gt; Payments &gt; Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.
Both options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.

On April 16rd, 2023 from 12:11 PM PDT until 14:39 PM PDT, certain Android users on the Free plan reported issues with loading channels in the Android app.  


Upon investigation, this was attributed to the implementation of a data optimization feature, intended to improve app performance. We have rolled back this feature temporarily, which has corrected the observed issue.  A full investigation and remedy will take place prior to reimplementation.

On April 10, 2023 at 7:30 PM PDT, some customers began experiencing delays when uploading files. We traced the issue back to a recent update made to how some file uploads are handled. Reverting this change fixed the issue, and customers were no longer experiencing it as of April 11, 2023 at 7:33 AM PDT.
