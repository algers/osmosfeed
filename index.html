Incident Report
Background
Gmail&#x27;s delivery system is responsible for routing, classifying, and enhancing emails. Emails are placed in a queue and are processed by a set of backend services (e.g. spam classification). If everything goes well, the mail delivery system sends the emails. However, when a failure occurs, the system keeps the emails in the queue and retries delivering them later.
Summary
On 10 December 2022 at 05:29 PT, some Gmail users observed email delivery delays of 60 minutes on average, as well as email bounce backs (i.e. senders received a delivery failure notification).
Root Cause
An email campaign from a single domain triggered a latent bug in one of the dependencies of the email delivery service, which crashed and then became overloaded. These emails contained dynamic mail content triggering service instance failures.  Due to this failure and a latent bug validation feature configuration, 80% of tasks crashed, which overloaded the remaining tasks.
Remediation and Prevention
On 10 December 2022 at 05:29 PT, Google Engineering was alerted to an issue via internal monitoring that Gmail delivery was impacted. Google Engineering began investigating and identified the following actions to mitigate the issue:
Increase the memory of the affected dependency.
Disable the feature that triggered the issue.
The backlog of emails were then able to to be processed without any additional issues.
Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Audit Gmail delivery dependencies.
Optimize the email validation feature configuration.
Implement automatic threshold protection against backlog overload.

We determined this issue was caused by a recent frontend change that caused a failure to load videos via the streaming protocol HLS (Hypertext Live Streaming), for which no fallback existed. 


To resolve this issue, we introduced a fallback to HLS allowing users to play video files with a slightly degraded experience, such as longer load times. 


Additionally, we disabled a code optimization technique which fully restored HLS functionality for all users.</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:


From December 14, 2022 at 04:30 PST to December 14, 2022 at 09:00 PST, we received reports from customers who were unable to receive SMS 2FA codes to login, we discovered that the Slack Twilio queue on the Twilio services was growing at a high rate and the outgoing SMS message error rate began to grow. Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. It was discovered that a majority of this traffic was coming from nefarious acting workspaces issuing too many app download link SMS requests to the Twilio service. With thousands of workspaces doing this at the same time, our queue became overloaded. The disposable email domains used to create these teams were added to a Total Ban blocklist preventing any users using the domains from accessing Slack — stopping team creation and further SMS pumping. Twilio was also able to drop the messages specific to app download links based on a content filter. With these actions, the queue was able to catch back up.</span>

From 10:12 AM PST until 10:25 AM PST on December 14, 2022, some customers had trouble loading Slack workspaces, sending messages, and uploading files.


Prior to this issue, we began removing traffic from an isolated location within a data center region as part of a planned exercise. Upon further investigation, we identified a bug within this process. We then stopped the process, which resolved the issue for all users. Error rates were monitored for a short while prior to announcing the resolution, in order to ensure the issue was fully resolved and would not reoccur.</span>

From December 8, 2022 at 03:15 PST to December 8, 2022 at 05:10 PST, some customers may have experienced issues with exports failing. This was due to a lack of disk space on one of the hosts running export jobs. We fixed this issue by terminating the host which resolved the problem for all affected customers.</span>

On December 4, 2022, from 5:00 PM PST to 11:14 PM, users ran into trouble where they did not receive 2FA codes on SMS, making them unable to log into Slack as a result. This issue was due to a service provider&#x27;s slow processing rate.


To fix this, we sorted out the processing backlog together with the service provider. We then had them raise the country specific processing rate limit, resolving the issue for our customers.</span>

From November 23, 2022 at 7:30pm PST to November 23, 2022 at 8:22pm PST, some users were unable to send messages, load content or use workflows within Slack. We discovered the issue was related to a recent change which accidentally severed access to a number of endpoints. A network change was made and most services started to auto-recover and work again. 


During the restore process some users experienced search errors or slow responses within the search bar. This was resolved on November 24, 2022 at 5:58pm PST, restoring functionality for all affected users.</span>

Severity: Critical
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon tailscaled, which can then be used to remotely execute code.
Affected platforms: Windows
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.
Who is affected?
All Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.
Reviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.

Severity: Low
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access Tailscale environment variables.
Affected platforms: All
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.
Who is affected?
All Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.
An attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.
There is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.
