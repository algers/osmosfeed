Resolved - From 14:44 UTC to 18:04 UTC we experienced another issue with our App Platform service related to CDN Insights for Apps in all regions. During this window, users might have observed blank graphs or no data for the CDN metrics including request counts, cache hit rates etc. Our engineering team was able to identify the problem and resolve it fully and as of 18:04 UTC all the metrics are displaying properly. 
The connectivity issue with the Apps for which we updated the status page earlier was only faced by a subset of users in FRA1 region, only between 12:45 UTC to 14:15 UTC. The normal functionality of apps was entirely restored around 14:15 UTC.
Thank you for your patience on this and if you continue to face issues then please open a support ticket from within the cloud control panel.</span>

On September 28, 2023 from approximately 11:54 AM PDT to 3:15 PM PDT, some Slack users experienced trouble receiving two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and therefore were unable to sign into Slack.


We determined this was caused by an upstream 2FA provider issue impacting code deliveries to US-based AT&amp;T and Verizon devices. We monitored communications from the provider and confirmed Slack users could successfully sign in once the upstream issue was resolved.</span>

From 8:00 AM PDT to 11:00 AM PDT on Thursday, September 28, 2023, a small number of users experienced delays in Slack, including sending and editing messages, and loading channels.


Upon investigation, we determined that a specific task in our backend was producing too many file deletion events and overloading our servers, resulting in these delays.


We implemented a fix to reduce the load on our servers and this resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

On September 27, 2023 from 9:01 AM PDT to 12:32 PM PDT, some users experienced issues when attempting to create or edit custom apps on https://api.slack.com/apps, including seeing a &quot;404 error&quot; on this website.


We traced this back to a recent change that removed a function necessary for rendering a documentation page associated with the website. 


We reverted the change, restoring the documentation page rendering component on https://api.slack.com/apps. Users should no longer have issues creating or editing custom apps and accessing this website.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
On 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Google Calendar web and mobile users experienced service disruption. These users may have seen “500 Internal” errors when trying to access Calendar on the web main page and while interacting with events for a duration of 3 hours and 15 minutes.  This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
A recent update to Google Calendar triggered an unintended bug that slowed down the service. This was compounded by an increase in invalid internet Calendar Scheduling (ICS) from Gmail to Calendar. As a result, some users may have seen intermittent 500 internal errors while using Google Calendar.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to this issue via internal monitoring on 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers mitigated the issue by scaling up Calendar resources and filtering traffic reaching Calendar backends. In addition, we rolled back the recent change in ICS file processing, resulting in traffic returning to normal levels. The issue was fully resolved on 21 Sept at 09:30 US/Pacific.
Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Optimize internal triggers for early performance degradation detection.
Isolate heavy performance processing to dedicated infrastructure.
Detailed Description of Impact
On 21 Sept from 06:30 to 09:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Calendar web users experienced intermittent error rates when accessing Calendar, leading to some users not being able to see their event information updated on Calendar.

On September 26, 2023 from 10:00 AM PDT to 12:00 PM PDT, some users on our new interface design couldn&#x27;t dismiss an information prompt that read &quot;You now have Later&quot;. 


These users also experienced their UI locking, and were unable to click anything in the Slack app. For some, the sparkle animation fixed over the Later icon in the sidebar also persisted longer than intended. 


We identified the root cause as a missing detail in a recent code change. We reverted the change to mitigate the immediate issue, then deployed a fix to fully resolve the problem for all impacted users.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

Resolved - On September 27, 2023 at 00:12 UTC, our alerting systems detected an increase in the time it took GitHub Actions workflow runs to start. During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.
	We mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC. We have additional repair items in place to prevent a recurrence in the future.

                              <span>Issue summary: 

From 12:54 PM PDT on September 22, 2023 to 09:13 AM PDT on September 25, 2023, custom emoji rendered as text for a small number of Enterprise Grid users.


We made a code change that inadvertently introduced unnecessary logging for routine emoji events. This unexpected logging increased traffic to the custom emoji infrastructure, impacting its performance. 


We deployed a fix to remove the unnecessary logging, which reduced traffic to the custom emoji systems and restored normal emoji rendering. 


A small fraction of the affected customers may have experienced lingering issues as the fix was gradually rolled out to everyone.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On September 21, 2023 from 8:00 PM PDT to 1:30 PM PDT, some users encountered a message stating &quot;Something went wrong&quot; when accessing the Slack Connect invites page.


We determined that rate limits set for querying invites were the cause of the &quot;Something went wrong&quot; message. These limits were set prior to the  product decision to include these in the Activity view. Because use of this view has increased, the limits are reached much sooner than originally expected.


These limits were lifted for the invites page, resolving the issue for users. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

From September 6, 2023 at 2:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 8:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

Resolved - From 6:25pm PDT - 6:46pm PDT, we experienced an issue that prevented users from accessing Notion. The issue has been resolved, so users should be able to access Notion again. We&#x27;ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we experience other issues.
Root cause: 
One of our memcache clusters crashed and caused our API cluster to get stuck. Engineering resolved the issue by restarting them. We’ll continue to investigate on what caused the cluster to crash.</span>

From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.</span>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…</span>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…</span>
