Incident Report
Summary
On Tuesday, 13 December 2022 at 07:34 PT, users of Gmail, Google Voice, and Google Chat experienced disruption in their services for a period of 2 hours and 30 minutes. To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have conducted an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the resiliency of our service.
Root Cause
The issue was caused by an unanticipated increase in traffic to the internal user ID management system used by multiple Google Workspace products. Upon further investigation, we identified that the overwhelming amount of traffic resulted from erroneous changes made to update the membership details from one of the upstream systems.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to this issue through automated monitoring, which also blocked the incoming traffic simultaneously within a few minutes. However, the high traffic during this period impacted downstream services.
Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Change the design in the internal user ID management system to not remove users, unless mentioned explicitly as allowed.
Introduce multiple redundancies in the system, including self-throttling auto-kill mechanisms in the involved systems to keep the traffic under a defined threshold.
Introduce robust control and process reviews for data changes.
Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.
Detailed Description of Impact
On Tuesday, 13 December 2022 between 07:34 and 10:04 PT, various Google Workspace products (noted below) experienced impact in their services:
Google Chat
Some users observed incorrect status indicators representing their presence and typing status.

Some SMS messages were delayed by an average of 1.2 minutes.
A limited number of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) registrations were not completed. Affected user devices may have been temporarily unable to place or receive calls.

From Monday December 12, 2022 at 10:27 AM PST to Monday December 19, 2022 at 1:30 PM PST, we began investigating reports of messages being marked as read when backgrounding the iOS app while in a conversation. As a result, the sidebar would not show unread messages next to the DM/Channel/Threads view. 


We have now made a change on our end that resolved the issue and released a fix on iOS app version 22.12.21. Users on the iOS app should now be able to receive messages without them being marked as read automatically.</span>

We determined this issue was caused by a recent frontend change that caused a failure to load videos via the streaming protocol HLS (Hypertext Live Streaming), for which no fallback existed. 


To resolve this issue, we introduced a fallback to HLS allowing users to play video files with a slightly degraded experience, such as longer load times. 


Additionally, we disabled a code optimization technique which fully restored HLS functionality for all users.</span>

From December 14, 2022 at 04:30 PST to December 14, 2022 at 09:00 PST, we received reports from customers who were unable to receive SMS 2FA codes to login, we discovered that the Slack Twilio queue on the Twilio services was growing at a high rate and the outgoing SMS message error rate began to grow. Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. It was discovered that a majority of this traffic was coming from nefarious acting workspaces issuing too many app download link SMS requests to the Twilio service. With thousands of workspaces doing this at the same time, our queue became overloaded. The disposable email domains used to create these teams were added to a Total Ban blocklist preventing any users using the domains from accessing Slack — stopping team creation and further SMS pumping. Twilio was also able to drop the messages specific to app download links based on a content filter. With these actions, the queue was able to catch back up.</span>

From 10:12 AM PST until 10:25 AM PST on December 14, 2022, some customers had trouble loading Slack workspaces, sending messages, and uploading files.


Prior to this issue, we began removing traffic from an isolated location within a data center region as part of a planned exercise. Upon further investigation, we identified a bug within this process. We then stopped the process, which resolved the issue for all users. Error rates were monitored for a short while prior to announcing the resolution, in order to ensure the issue was fully resolved and would not reoccur.</span>

From December 8, 2022 at 03:15 PST to December 8, 2022 at 05:10 PST, some customers may have experienced issues with exports failing. This was due to a lack of disk space on one of the hosts running export jobs. We fixed this issue by terminating the host which resolved the problem for all affected customers.</span>
