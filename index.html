On February 7, 2024 from around 9:23 AM PST to 9:51 AM PST, a small percentage of users may have experienced issues connecting to Slack or searching within Slack. 


Our automated alerting systems detected an unusual spike in traffic to one of our servers. We carried out a thorough investigation, but the load subsided naturally as we worked, resolving the issue for all affected users.

Resolved - As of 19:37 UTC, our Engineering team has confirmed the full resolution of the problem impacting the Droplet resize events in all regions. All the Droplet resize events should now be succeeding normally. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team. 
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Feb  7, 19:41 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has fully deployed the fix for the issue with Droplet resizes and is now monitoring the situation. Users can now retry Droplet resizes and should see them succeed.
We&#x27;ll post another update once we confirm the fix resolves this incident.
Feb  7, 15:49 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue with failed Droplet resizes and a fix is in the process of being deployed. 
Users attempting to resize Droplets where the image for the Droplet has been deleted or retired (e.g. a user created a Droplet from a Snapshot, but later deleted that Snapshot) will see failures. All other resizes are succeeding normally.
We&#x27;ll post another update once the fix has completed deployment.
Feb  7, 15:32 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an uptick in failed Droplet resizes, beginning Feb 6, 20:57 UTC. 
During this time, some users may experience failures when attempting to resize Droplets, in all regions. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
Feb  7, 08:55 PST
Monitoring - Our Async Request Processing system had an issue this morning, which resulted in increased delays between the time a request was enqueued and when it was processed, and may have resulted in an elevated processing failure rate. This began around 8:10 AM PST, and was resolved by 9:15 AM PST.
We are still actively monitoring, but are not expecting any ongoing issues at this time.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Feb  6, 17:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Feb  2, 20:23 UTC
Scheduled - Start Time: 17:00 UTC Feb 6, 2024
End Time: 00:00 UTC Feb 7, 2024
During the above time, our Engineering Team will be performing maintenance to failover some internal databases from one cluster to another.
Extensive testing has been conducted to ensure this maintenance will be successful and result in minimal impact to DigitalOcean users. The actual failover is estimated to take less than 3 seconds.
Existing infrastructure, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, should continue running without issue. There is no network disruption to existing services expected as part of this maintenance. However, there are dependencies on multiple services. During the failover, there may be customer impacts that should be brief and transitory. The following actions may experience increased latency or failure rates during the maintenance period:
- API calls to the DigitalOcean public API 
- Events for Droplets and Droplet-based services such as create, delete, power on/off, resize, etc 
- Control operations through the DigitalOcean Cloud Control Panel 
Multiple teams will be engaged to keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate any impact that does occur. We’ll post updates here for any unexpected changes to this scheduled maintenance, as well as progress updates during the maintenance itself.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.</span>

Resolved - Between 3:00 UTC - 14:22 UTC, some users may have experienced database automation failures or delays in actions being triggered.
This is now resolved, and the affected automations have completed. Database automation services are now running as normal. 
Thank you for your patience while we worked through this issue.
Feb  5, 05:30 PST
Monitoring - Notion&#x27;s database automation service began experiencing problems at approximately 3 AM UTC today, which caused a number of automation actions to fail or experience delays. 
Our engineers have identified a fix, and are now retrying automations that failed to trigger during this period. 
We will continue to monitor the situation and share an update when this is fully resolved.</span>

Resolved - On 2024-02-05, from 09:26 to 13:20 UTC some GitHub customers experienced errors when trying to download raw files. An overloaded server exposed a bug, causing us to return HTTP 500 error codes.
The issue was mitigated by disabling the server and re-routing traffic. We are implementing improvements to our routing logic to more quickly avoid troublesome hosts in the future. 

Feb  5, 09:40 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Git Operations</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:


On February 1, 2024 between 12:57 AM PST and 3:52 AM PST, some users in Germany were having trouble receiving two-factor authentication codes via SMS.


This was caused by an issue with a service provider and has now been resolved.


Users in Germany should no longer be having trouble and may also choose to use an authentication app to receive their 2FA codes instead of SMS.


Thank you for being patient with us, we appreciate it.</span>

Resolved - An update to our design system caused issues loading dynamic content in the global side navigation menu and in other page-specific sidebar navigation elements. Impacted users saw continuous loading spinners in place of dynamic menu content. User impact lasted from 0:55 UTC to 4:41 UTC on February 1st.
We are working on a number of improvements in response to this incident. We are adding request volume monitors to sidebar navigation endpoints and making changes to our front end escalation paths to improve our time to detect and time to recovery for incidents of this nature. We have also begun work to improve both automated and manual testing for these types of changes in order to prevent recurrence.
Feb  1, 04:41 UTC
Update - This issue has been resolved. A reload of your browser window/tab may be required if you continue to experience issues with the collapsable navigation sidebars not loading.

Resolved - This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.
The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.
For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn&#x27;t developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.
We have so far identified three remediation items here:
- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.
- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.
- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.
Jan 31, 14:56 UTC
Update - We have resolved the issue and confirmed all regions are now operating as expected.
Jan 31, 14:49 UTC
Update - The fix for ip allow lists is currently rolling out; and we are awaiting confirmation from specific geographic regions.
Jan 31, 14:33 UTC
Update - We are rolling out a fix to resolve the issues with IP allow lists. This should be resolved shortly.

From 11:37 AM PST to 11:48 AM PST on January 24, 2024, we experienced an unexpected amount of API calls to our servers that occurred within a short window of time. The volume of API calls resulted in some users experiencing latency loading channels and general difficulties connecting to Slack. We investigated the impact with a broad lens and began to observe signs of recovery around 12:09 PM PST.


During this time, we cautiously observed our health metrics to ensure our servers were accurately recovering. As a result of our thorough monitoring, there was a delay before we could confirm the issue was fully resolved. Our teams have also put in measures to help reduce the likelihood of this occurring again in the future.</span>

                              <span>Description: We resolved an information disclosure vulnerability in the
hello.ts.net service.
What happened?
On January 15 2024, we became aware of a potential information disclosure
vulnerability in the hello.ts.net service, which could show the identity of a
different Tailscale user when loaded. The hello.ts.net service receives
identity information and public keys of nodes tied to their IP address. On
November 28 2023, we made a change to how IPs are assigned to
Tailscale nodes, making them globally non-unique. When the Tailscale service
assigned the same IP to multiple nodes, hello.ts.net would receive identity
information for one of the nodes at random. We confirmed on January 26 2024
that, if one of the other nodes with that IP loaded hello.ts.net, they would
see another user&#x27;s name, email, and hostname.
The Tailscale Security Team immediately took hello.ts.net offline while the
fix was in progress. The issue has been fixed and the hello.ts.net service
was restored on January 29 2024.
Who was affected?
The incident was isolated to 10 users across 9 tailnets who could have had
their information leaked to other Tailscale users. We notified the tailnet
security contacts directly in accordance with our obligations under applicable
data privacy laws. Due to the random nature of the vulnerability, we cannot
confirm that all of those users were indeed affected.
Regular shared nodes always see unique node IPs and were not
vulnerable in a manner similar to hello.ts.net.
What was the impact?
A small number of users had their name, email, and hostname potentially exposed
to other Tailscale users that had nodes sharing the same IP.
In addition, the hello.ts.net service was offline between January 26-29
2024. Several users reported being negatively impacted by this.
What do I need to do?
No action is needed at this time.
If you have a dependency on hello.ts.net as a probing target for Tailscale
connectivity, consider using a different probing
mechanism.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the workaround fix is successful and all services should now be operating normally. We will now close this incident and work with the DNS provider separately on the root cause. 
We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team for further review.
Jan 29, 18:18 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue with DNS resolution. DigitalOcean resolvers in use in FRA1, AMS3, and LON1 are unable to reach an upstream DNS provider, resulting in resolution for a subset of domain names being unavailable from our resolvers. Our Engineering team is reaching out to the provider for assistance.
In the meantime, our Engineering team has been able to implement a workaround fix by filtering some incorrectly announced network routes. At this time, we are seeing recovery and resolution of hostnames returning to normal in the impacted regions. We&#x27;ll continue to await an update from the DNS provider. We&#x27;re now monitoring the workaround fix for stability and will post an update once we are confident it is successful.
Jan 29, 17:27 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is currently investigating issues with DNS resolution in FRA1, AMS3, and LON1. During this time, customers may experience errors trying to resolve domain names from within DigitalOcean services in those regions, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as App Platform. Additionally, App Platform builds may fail or experience delays. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - On January 28, 2024, between 01:00 UTC and 14:00 UTC the Avatars service was degraded and could not return all avatar images requested by users, instead it would return a default, fallback avatar image. This incident impacted, at peak time 6% of the requests for viewing Avatars. Requests that were impacted did not prevent the users from continuing to use any GitHub services. This was due to an issue with the Avatars service connecting to a database host.
 We mitigated the incident by restarting the malfunctioning hosts that were not able to return the user avatar images.
 We are working to improve alerting and monitoring of our services to reduce our time to detection and mitigation.
Jan 28, 14:27 UTC
Update - We have mitigated all customer impact. We are no longer serving fallback avatar icons when loading web pages for some customers. We continue to monitor the results.
Jan 28, 13:57 UTC
Update - A fix has been implemented for customers seeing the default avatar (octocat) when loading web pages and we are monitoring the results.
Jan 28, 13:20 UTC
Update - Some requests for getting the Avatars are returning the fallback response instead of the asked avatar since they are having issues connecting to the Mysql host
Jan 28, 13:20 UTC
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

From 1:00pm PST on January 23, 2024 to 2:30pm PST on January 23, 2024, some users encountered trouble uploading, downloading, and viewing files in Slack.


We determined that an API call was not functioning correctly, and made a change to mitigate the issue. The upload problems were caused by a slowing down of responses due to a higher than normal volume of API calls due to the malfunction. This issue has been resolved and steps have been taken to avoid it happening in the future.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

From 12:20pm PST until 3:00pm PST on January 22, 2024, some Enterprise Grid users noticed multiple Slackbot responses being triggered unexpectedly.


We determined that the rollout of a fix for an older bug report pertaining to Slackbot responses not working in org-wide or multi-workspace channels, was the root cause. 


Whilst the fix for the bug was intended to improve this features behaviour, ensuring that Slackbot custom responses would work in these channel types, our wider team concluded that the fixed behaviour might not function well for organizations with potentially thousands of custom Slackbot responses.


We rolled back the deployment which caused this behaviour. Customers will no longer see these Slackbot custom responses being triggered unexpectedly.


A discussion is underway about the long-term future of Slackbot custom response behaviour within large organizations.


Thank you for your patience whilst we resolved this.</span>

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 at 3:38 UTC, we experienced an incident that affected customers using Codespaces. Customers encountered issues creating and resuming Codespaces in multiple regions due to operational issues with compute and storage resources.
Around 25% of customers were impacted, primarily in East US and West Europe. We re-routed traffic for Codespace creations to less impacted regions, but existing Codespaces in these regions may have been unable to resume during the incident.
By 7:30 UTC, we had recovered connectivity to all regions except West Europe, which had an extended recovery time due to increased load in that particular region. The incident was resolved on 2024-01-21 at 9:34 UTC once Codespace creations and resumes were working normally in all regions.

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 from 02:05 UTC to 06:19 UTC, GitHub Hosted Runners experienced increased error rates from our main cloud service provider. The errors were initially limited to a single region and we were able to route around the issue by transparently failing over to other regions. However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.
During the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.
We’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.
Jan 21, 05:54 UTC
Update - We&#x27;ve applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.
Jan 21, 05:26 UTC
Update - We have mitigated the issues impacting Actions Larger Runners. We are still experiencing delays starting normal jobs, and are continuing to investigate.
Jan 21, 04:53 UTC
Update - The team has identified the cause of the issues with Actions Larger Runners and has begun mitigation.
Jan 21, 04:16 UTC
Update - The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time and a percentage of jobs failing. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.
Jan 21, 03:45 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

🔤 How Does it Work?

Here&#x27;s a quick overview of how KeyNest Points operate:
Drop your keys at a local KeyNest Point.
Your keys are tagged and logged into the system for real-time tracking.
Staff at the Point securely stores your keys.
Send the location of the key and the code to your guests within your automated Smily messages.
Guests or cleaners visit the Point, show their safety code, and receive the key.

                              <span>Issue summary:

From 11:26 AM PST on January 12, 2024 to 10:04 AM PST on January 15, 2024, some users were unable to configure 2FA on their accounts. We were made aware of this after a spike in reports early in the morning of Monday, January 15.


Upon investigation, this issue was traced back to a recent code change which we discovered was preventing users from being redirected back to the 2FA configuration page after entering their password during the 2FA setup process. We immediately reverted this change which fully resolved the issue.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From approximately 20:15 - 21:45 UTC, DigitalOcean experienced a global networking issue that impacted multiple services and products. Users saw increased error rates and latency for event processing, accessing our Cloud Control Panel/API, applying Cloud Firewall policies, accessing www.digitalocean.com and our Community site, and DNS resolution. Additionally, users saw timeouts/increased latency for networking requests to Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as connections to existing App Platform Apps. 
We sincerely apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience issues or have questions, please reach out to our Support team by opening a ticket from within your account. …</span>

Improvement
  
We&#x27;re thrilled to share a new feature we’ve just released for booking.com properties.
What&#x27;s New?
The rate rule Booking at least &#x27;x&#x27; day ahead is now synchronised on booking.com channel;
Why Does This Matter?
You were facing the obstacle where Guests were making a booking for the same day or &#x27;x&#x27; days (based on your settings) even though the setting to prevent that was activated;
-&gt; It won’t happen anymore.
What&#x27;s Next?
If you face any obstacle with this setting, reach out to us; 
We are and will be working on more improvements to make your day-to-day easier :)
