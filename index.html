On September 27, 2023 from 4:01 PM PDT to 7:32 PM PDT, some users experienced issues when attempting to create or edit custom apps on https://api.slack.com/apps, including seeing a &quot;404 error&quot; on this website.


We traced this back to a recent change that removed a function necessary for rendering a documentation page associated with the website. 


We reverted the change, restoring the documentation page rendering component on https://api.slack.com/apps. Users should no longer have issues creating or editing custom apps and accessing this website.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
On 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Google Calendar web and mobile users experienced service disruption. These users may have seen “500 Internal” errors when trying to access Calendar on the web main page and while interacting with events for a duration of 3 hours and 15 minutes.  This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
A recent update to Google Calendar triggered an unintended bug that slowed down the service. This was compounded by an increase in invalid internet Calendar Scheduling (ICS) from Gmail to Calendar. As a result, some users may have seen intermittent 500 internal errors while using Google Calendar.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to this issue via internal monitoring on 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers mitigated the issue by scaling up Calendar resources and filtering traffic reaching Calendar backends. In addition, we rolled back the recent change in ICS file processing, resulting in traffic returning to normal levels. The issue was fully resolved on 21 Sept at 09:30 US/Pacific.
Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Optimize internal triggers for early performance degradation detection.
Isolate heavy performance processing to dedicated infrastructure.
Detailed Description of Impact
On 21 Sept from 06:30 to 09:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Calendar web users experienced intermittent error rates when accessing Calendar, leading to some users not being able to see their event information updated on Calendar.

On September 26, 2023 from 5:00pm PDT to 7:00pm PDT, some users on our new interface design couldn&#x27;t dismiss an information prompt that read &quot;You now have Later&quot;. 


These users also experienced their UI locking, and were unable to click anything in the Slack app. For some, the sparkle animation fixed over the Later icon in the sidebar also persisted longer than intended. 


We identified the root cause as a missing detail in a recent code change. We reverted the change to mitigate the immediate issue, then deployed a fix to fully resolve the problem for all impacted users.</span>

From 7:54 PM PDT on September 22, 2023 to 4:13 PM PDT on September 25, 2023, custom emoji rendered as text for a small number of Enterprise Grid users.


We made a code change that inadvertently introduced unnecessary logging for routine emoji events. This unexpected logging increased traffic to the custom emoji infrastructure, impacting its performance. 


We deployed a fix to remove the unnecessary logging, which reduced traffic to the custom emoji systems and restored normal emoji rendering. 


A small fraction of the affected customers may have experienced lingering issues as the fix was gradually rolled out to everyone.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On September 21, 2023 from 3:00 PM PDT to 8:30 PM PDT, some users encountered a message stating &quot;Something went wrong&quot; when accessing the Slack Connect invites page.


We determined that rate limits set for querying invites were the cause of the &quot;Something went wrong&quot; message. These limits were set prior to the  product decision to include these in the Activity view. Because use of this view has increased, the limits are reached much sooner than originally expected.


These limits were lifted for the invites page, resolving the issue for users. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</span>

Tired of billing problems taking up a lot of your time? We understand!
Not long ago, we introduced some changes to our pricing model, which now takes into account your Gross Booking Value (GBV) and adjusts your monthly fee accordingly. Since this change, we understand that you’ve experienced some issues with your monthly payments to Smily and that this has been incredibly frustrating for you.
We are working hard to improve your payments experience, so that you no longer have to spend your time and energy solving payment issues.
We’re very happy to announce the first in a series of changes to the way in which you pay for Smily.

From September 6, 2023 at 9:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 3:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.</span>

Resolved - From 6:25pm PDT - 6:46pm PDT, we experienced an issue that prevented users from accessing Notion. The issue has been resolved, so users should be able to access Notion again. We&#x27;ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we experience other issues.
Root cause: 
One of our memcache clusters crashed and caused our API cluster to get stuck. Engineering resolved the issue by restarting them. We’ll continue to investigate on what caused the cluster to crash.</span>

From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.</span>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…</span>

From 11:00 PM PDT on September 1, 2023 to 01:00 AM PDT on September 2, 2023, some users in India may have had issues with the messaging functionality in Slack.


We determined that the issue was caused by too many requests causing our database to be overwhelmed.


To resolve the issue, we created additional hosts and redistributed the requests which fixed the issue for affected users.

On August 23, 2023 from 4:30 PM PDT to August 31, 2023 11:26 PM PDT, some users experienced an issue posting messages in the designated #general channel of their workspace. 


Our team identified that recent changes in our code broke some conditional logic and deprecated the preference that allows users to post in the #general channel.


We pushed out a fix and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue.</span>

From 11:32 PM PDT on August 29, 2023 to 02:06 AM PDT on August 30, 2023, some users may have seen an internal server or connection error in workflow and app modals.


We determined that a code change inadvertently caused an issue where incorrect data was stored in our database. When a modal was opened it used this incorrect data and displayed a connection error to users.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>
