From March 20, 2024 at 10:28 AM PDT to March 25, 2024 at 6:14 AM PDT, some customers in the US were unable to receive 2FA SMS codes.

This issue was traced to customers with a specific mobile carrier. We engaged with our upstream provider, who worked with the carrier to resolve the issue. 

Impacted customers should no longer be experiencing any trouble receiving 2FA SMS codes.

This was traced to a backend change related to how Workflow Builder searches for a Google Sheet when using the Google Sheets workflow step, but the user interface was not receiving proper label values causing the error. 

We reverted the change as an initial attempt to fix, but learned this didn&#x27;t resolve the issue as we continued to see incorrect value data.

We corrected the problematic piece of code that allowed for the Google Sheets step to properly search for the spreadsheet using the correct search value. This restored the workflow step to full functionality.</span>

Completed - Scheduled maintenance has completed ahead of schedule, with no observed customer impact. Thank you for your patience. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.
Mar 26, 17:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Mar 21, 18:15 UTC
Scheduled - Start Time: March 26 17:00 UTC
End Time: March 26 18:00 UTC
During this time, our Engineering Team will be performing maintenance to failover an internal service from one cluster to another. 
This maintenance has been previously conducted with limited impact and our team has done extensive planning and testing to ensure a smooth failover, with the least disruption possible.
Existing infrastructure (including Droplet and Droplet-based services networking) will continue running without issue. 
If the failover period lasts longer than expected, there may be customer impacts with associated services including: 
Droplet creates with a root password
Droplet root password resets 
MongoDB cluster creates 
Let’sEncrypt certificate creation (for Load Balancers and Spaces)
LoadBalancer creation with certificates
Spaces key creation
Marketplace (Add-Ons) will be unavailable for both vendors and users
App Platform builds and deploys may see latency 
Users will be unable to fetch CSV invoices 
Bulk actions in the Spaces UI
At this time, we do not expect to see any of the above listed impacts during maintenance, but are prepared for the worst case if needed.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.</span>

Resolved - On March 22nd 2024 between 1:00AM PDT - 2:45AM PDT, Notion was experiencing a systemwide outage preventing users from saving pages and making edits. This also affected access to Notion and edits through our Public API.
Our engineering team identified an issue with a bottleneck in our server traffic which caused service degradation. We reset the affected services to resolve this issue and restore this functionality.
We are continuing to review this issue and working to prevent recurrence of this problem.
Mar 22, 03:06 PDT
Monitoring - Our engineers have reset the affected services and users can now save and edit pages in Notion as normal.
We are monitoring the situation to ensure this issue does not reoccur and will share further updates when this issue is definitively resolved.
Mar 22, 02:15 PDT
Identified - Our engineers have identified the cause of the issue and are working to restore service for all users.
We are seeing some improvements and will share more updates as soon as possible as we get closer to a full resolution.
Mar 22, 01:41 PDT
Investigating - Notion is failing to save pages and edits due to a system error. Our engineering team is fully focused on resolving the issue and we will share updates as soon as possible</span>

Improvement
  
We&#x27;re thrilled to announce an important update to our monthly billing process, driven by your valuable feedback. 🙌
We understand that receiving multiple invoices for your Smily subscription throughout the month has been an accounting headache for some of our customers. Therefore, we&#x27;ve made changes to streamline our billing process and improve your experience.
Starting immediately, all charges for new rentals will be consolidated onto one invoice, which will be issued on your account renewal date. This means that you will no longer receive separate invoices for each new rental added to your Smily account.
What does this mean for you?
📃 Consolidated Invoicing: on your account renewal date, you will receive an invoice for your Smily subscription for the upcoming month…</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:
On March 20, 2024 from around 8:05 AM PDT until 10:33 PM PDT, some users experienced various issues with Slack such as loading channel membership lists, joining a channel, setting or clearing their user statuses, loading profile images, incorrect huddle status, and inconsistent user states if a user was recently deactivated or reactivated.

A recent change to resolve an unrelated traffic issue we observed with our backend servers inadvertently caused connections to database caching services to timeout.

At around 12:00 PM PDT, we had identified the cause of the timeout failures and began gradually deploying a fix. We continued to closely monitor our health metrics for any abnormalities as our remediation progressed.

By 10:33 PM PDT, the deploy successfully reached all affected users, these users would have immediately received the fix through a hard refresh of their Slack client (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R). By 8:49 AM PDT on March 21, 2024, most affected users received the fix without a required hard refresh.

We are continuing to investigate this issue and implement preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of this occurring again in the future.</span>

On March 19, 2024 from 2:50 PM PDT to 8:16 PM PDT, less than 1% of users were unable to load Slack. 

A corrupted table in our database infrastructure prevented one of our databases from responding to requests, causing connection issues for customers whose workspaces were hosted on that database. We manually triggered a backup of the affected database. While we always have backups in place, we were concerned that the existing replicas would be affected by the same bug. We used this manual backup to provision new databases, spinning up several fresh replicas. 

Once the replicas were up and running, we directed traffic from the impacted workspaces to these new databases. This restored access for affected customers. We continued working to address the bug that caused the original issue to prevent this from occurring to any other database.</span>

From 1:00 PM PDT on March 16, 2024 to 2:57 PM PDT on March 18, 2024, some users encountered a REB434A8313F error message when attempting to access the External Connections tab in Slack. On March 16th, a small number of users reported impact, however, it was later determined that more users were affected. 

We determined that a recent backend change to the navigation bar badging rules was preventing this view from loading properly. We reverted this change, which resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Mar 17, 02:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Mar 12, 16:11 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2024-03-17 02:00 UTC
End: 2024-03-17 05:00 UTC
During the above maintenance window, there will be maintenance performed on our ticketing system.
Expected Impact:
During the course of the maintenance, users will be unable to submit support tickets, update existing tickets, or receive replies to existing tickets. Users will also be unable to log into https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/ or open the Support Portal from within the Cloud Control Panel.
Any tickets submitted during the maintenance via alternate methods (such as replying to an email chain or via our webform) will be saved and entered into our ticketing system at the completion of the maintenance.
Our Support Team will also be impacted by this maintenance and will be unable to enter the ticketing system to receive any tickets or reply to existing tickets. As soon as the vendor maintenance has completed, our team will address all support queries as quickly as possible.
We appreciate your patience throughout this process.</span>

Resolved - On March 15, 2024, between 19:42 UTC and 20:24 UTC several services were degraded due to a regression in calling the permissions system. 
New GitHub Codespaces could not be created, as were Codespaces sessions that required minting a new auth token.
Actions saw delays and infrastructure failures due to the upstream dependency on fetching tokens for the repository for runs to successfully execute. 
GitHub Pages were affected due to the impact on Actions, resulting in 1266 page builds failing, which at the low point represented 33% of page builds failing. This resulted in page edits not being reflected on those impacted sites.
We deployed an application update that included a newer version of our database query builder. The new version uses a newer MySQL syntax f…</span>

From 12:40 PM to 4:55 PM PDT on March 13, 2024, users from one Enterprise Grid organization may have experienced slowness or connectivity issues when using Slack.

A routine infrastructure process inadvertently caused an increase in requests to the database hosting the affected Enterprise Grid organization. This resulted in slower than usual response times for user actions in Slack, and some connectivity failures. 

We identified the cause of the problem and manually increased the database capacity, restoring normal functionality for impacted users. 

Thank you for bearing with us while we resolved this issue.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
On Wednesday, 06 March 2024, Google Workspace users experienced elevated errors while accessing user or device setting pages within the Chrome Admin Console for a duration of 1 hour, 27 minutes.
To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
Google Workspace Admin Console uses a backend authentication service to grant privileged access to internal accounts. As part of ongoing efforts to migrate the account authorization workflow to a new backend authentication service, Google engineers identified and cleaned up invalid account role assignments in the configuration.
During this clean up effort, engineers identified a privilege which was undefined in the application manifest and removed it from the configuration. Upon further investigation, engineering confirmed the privilege was mapped to an access control setting used by the Admin Console for Chrome. This change resulted in users being unable to access Chrome user and device settings page.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were alerted to the outage via an internal monitoring alert on Wednesday, 06 March 2024 at 15:04 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 15:36 and the incident was fully resolved at 15:59 once the rollback completed.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Improve procedural documentation on how to safely cleanup access control settings from authorization configuration.
Complete thorough investigation of privilege usage for the Admin Console to prevent further issues of this type.
Identify and register a new owner for this privilege in the application manifest and create permission mapping for faster verification in the future.
Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.

Resolved - From March 12, 2024 23:39 UTC to March 13, 2024 1:58 UTC, some Pull Requests updates were delayed and did not reflect the latest code that had been pushed. On average, 20% of Pull Requests page loads were out of sync and up to 30% of Pull Requests were impacted at peak. An internal component of our job queueing system was incorrectly handling invalid messages, resulting in stalled processing.
We mitigated the incident by shipping a fix to handle the edge case gracefully and allow processing to continue.
Once the fix was deployed at 1:47 UTC, our systems fully caught up with pending background jobs at 1:58 UTC.
We’re working to improve resiliency to invalid messages in our system to prevent future delays for these pull request updates. We are also reviewing our monitoring and observability to identify and remediate these types of failure cases faster.

On March 11, 2024 from 2:43 PM PDT until 3:43 PM PDT some users in workspaces using International Data Residency (IDR) experienced issues with several Slack features, including messages loading or sending, channels appearing blank, canvases loading, huddles connecting, and trouble with some workflows were also noted.

We identified a spike in error rates that was tied to a recent change to a backend service configuration logic. This change resulted in a cache discrepancy between services causing the errors. We rolled back the recent changes which immediately reduced error rates, resolving the issue for affected users. We are working on modifying the service handler in an effort to reduce the likelihood of this occurring in the future.</span>

Resolved - On March 11, 2024 starting at 22:45 UTC and ending on March 12, 2024 00:48 UTC various GitHub services were degraded and returned intermittent errors for users. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: API error rates as high as 1%, Copilot error rates as high as 17%, and Secret Scanning and 2FA using GitHub Mobile error rates as high as 100% followed by a drop in error rates to 30% starting at 22:55 UTC. This elevated error rate was due to a degradation of our centralized authentication service upon which many other services depend.
The issue was caused by a deployment of network related configuration that was inadvertently applied to the incorrect environment. This error was detected within 4 minutes and a rollback was initiated. While e…</span>

Resolved - On March 11, 2024 between at 18:44 UTC and 19:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and some users experienced errors when trying to queue workflows. Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.
The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.
We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.

Mar 11, 19:21 UTC
Update - Actions experienced a period of decreased workflow run throughput, and we are seeing recovery now.  We are in the process of investigating the cause.
Mar 11, 19:02 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

Resolved - On March 11, 2024, between 06:30 UTC and 11:45 UTC the Copilot Chat service was degraded and customers may have encountered errors or timed out requests for chat interactions. On average, the error rate was 10% and peaked at 45% of requests to the service for short periods of time.
This was due to a gap in handling an edge case for messages returned from the underlying language models. We mitigated the incident by applying a fix to the handling of the streaming response.
We are working to update monitoring to reduce time to detection and increase resiliency to message format changes.
Mar 11, 10:02 UTC
Update - We are deploying mitigations for the failures we have been observing in some chat requests for Copilot. We will continue to monitor and update.
Mar 11, 09:03 UTC
Update - We are seeing an elevated failure rate for chat requests for Copilot. We are investigating and will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.
Mar 11, 08:14 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Copilot</span>

On March 6, 2024 from 7:45 PM PST to around 9:33 PM PST customers reported that they were receiving a 500 error when viewing the legacy Incoming Webhook custom integration page.

We identified a backend code change that inadvertently changed data that the Incoming Webhook page needed to load which consequently caused the page to respond with an HTTP 500 error.

We rolled back the change, correcting the issue and all customers should now be able to access the Incoming Webhook page as expected.</span>

We determined that a recent change that was made to the video codec of Huddles, which may have been moving more of the video encoding to the computer&#x27;s Graphic Processing Unit. This would cause performance problems &amp; freezing during a screen share.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed that this incident has been fully resolved.
If you continue to experience any issues with Managed Database Clusters please open a ticket with our support team. Thank you for your patience.
Mar  5, 20:28 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has implemented a fix to resolve the issue with our Managed Databases services. At this time, we&#x27;re observing error rates returning to pre-incident levels and seeing operations such as create/fork/restore succeed. Trusted sources updates are also functioning normally, so connectivity to Database clusters from newly added resources to trusted sources is restored. 
We are monitoring the situation closely and will post an update as soon as we confirm the issue is fully resolved.

During the above window, we will be performing maintenance in our BLR1 region as part of a firewall migration. This maintenance was previously attempted on 2024-02-19 but the changes were reverted after our Engineers encountered unexpected issues, resulting from the maintenance. Our team has performed a thorough examination of the previous attempt and is confident in performing this maintenance, as well as measures to mitigate any negative outcomes. 
Expected impact:
As part of this maintenance, event processing in BLR1 will be delayed for a period of up to 15 minutes during the one-hour window. During this period, users will experience a delay with creating, destroying, or modifying new or existing DO services in BLR1(such as Droplets, DBaaS/DOKS clusters, etc.), existing services that are running should not be impacted.
If you have any questions related to this issue, please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket</span>

On March 4, 2024, from 4:18 PM PST until 10:17 PM PST some users experienced an issue when sharing their screen during a huddle. Attempting to share their screen would fail without any error or warning.

An incorrect piece of code was identified as the cause of the screen share issue. We safely reverted the problematic code, resolving the issue that users experienced. To capture the fix, a hard refresh (by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R) may be required.</span>

Resolved - On March 1, 2024, between 17:00 UTC and 17:42 UTC, we saw elevated failure rates (from 1 to 10%) for Copilot, Actions, Pages, and Git for various APIs.
This incident was triggered by a newly-discovered failure mode of a deployment pipeline to one of our compute clusters when it could not write a specific configuration file. This caused a drop in the amount of resources available in this cluster, which was mitigated by a redeployment.
We have addressed the specific scenario to ensure resources are properly written and retrieved and added safeguards to ensure the deployment does not proceed if there is an issue of this type.  We are also reviewing our systems to more effectively route traffic toward healthy clusters during an outage and adding more safeguards on cluster resource adjustments.

Resolved - On March 1, 2024, between 14:17 UTC and 15:54 UTC the service that sends messages from our event stream into our background job processing service was degraded and delayed the transmission of jobs for processing.  No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.
We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.

Mar  1, 16:12 UTC
Update - Issues, Pull Requests and Actions are operating normally.
Mar  1, 15:48 UTC
Update - We&#x27;re seeing our background job queue sizes trend down, and expect full recovery in the next 15 minutes.

Update - Issues is experiencing degraded performance. We are continuing to investigate.
Mar  1, 15:27 UTC
Update - We&#x27;re continuing to investigate issues with background jobs that have impacted Actions and Pull Requests. We have a mitigation in place and are monitoring for recovery.
Mar  1, 14:51 UTC
Update - We&#x27;re investigating issues with background jobs that are causing sporadic delays in pull request synchronization and reduced Actions throughput.

On February 29, 2024 from 1:28 PM PST to around 4:36 PM PST, users were unable to create or update some workflows.

We determined that a recent code change had inadvertently introduced a logic problem, resulting in errors for workflows that used event triggers. We reverted this code change. However, rolling back reintroduced a separate issue that we&#x27;d resolved earlier in the day. 

We prepared a tailored revert to roll back the code causing the workflow problem while also including the fix for the previous issue. This second revert resolved both problems, restoring full functionality to Slack. 

Thank you for being patient with us.</span>

Resolved - On February 29, 2024, between 9:32 and 11:54 UTC, queuing in our background job service caused processing delays to Webhooks, Actions, and Issues. Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.
We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed that creation, forking, and restoration of PostgreSQL clusters on v16 is functioning correctly.
Upgrades for lower-versioned PostgreSQL clusters to v16 remain unavailable at this time and users will see errors if they attempt to perform that upgrade. Our Engineering team continues to work on making upgrades to v16 available again, but we expect this to take some time.
If you continue to experience issues or have any questions, please open a ticket with our support team.

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to core networking infrastructure, to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. 
Expected impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience increased latency or a brief disruption in network traffic. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

                              <span>Issue summary: 
On February 26, 2024, from 9:21 AM PST to 9:16 AM PST on February 27, some users encountered the close button disappearing in the right pane where threads and profiles are viewed.

We discovered this was caused by a missing check in the change workspace process that prevented the right pane elements from rendering properly. Once the cause was identified, a change was made to the logic for drawing Slack&#x27;s interface when switching workspaces. Once the change was rolled out, the issue was resolved.</span>
