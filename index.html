                              <span>We have found a workaround for users facing the issue where using the workflow tool to add a row to a spreadsheet is inserting incorrect time information. 


As a workaround, highlight the Submission Time column and go to 

Format → Number → Custom Number Format and insert: ddd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss.


Going forward, we’ll continue working on this as a bug that we’ll track internally. If you’re still experiencing this behaviour, please reach out to us at feedback@slack.com.</span>

INCIDENT REPORT
Summary:
On Saturday, 03 September 2022 21:00 US/Pacific, Google Calendar experienced an issue with a mismatch in Daylight Savings time in Chile for a duration of 3 days, 22 hours, 36 minutes. The issue was mitigated on Wednesday, 07 September 2022 07:36 US/Pacific. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.
Root Cause:
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (also known as IANA) is a standards organization that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers. As part of its mission, IANA maintains global time zone information [1], commonly known as the time zone database, the Olson time zone database, or just the “tzdb”. This database is not released on a schedule, just when global time zone changes require it.
Chile had a scheduled time zone change on Sunday, 04 September 2022. However, because of elections occurring around the same time, the government decided to postpone the start date of Daylight Savings time from Sunday, 04 September 2022 to Sunday, 11 September 2022. The Chilean government announced this decision on 08 August 2022, less than a month in advance.
IANA released version 2022b of the time zone database on Thursday, 11 August 2022, followed by 2022c (to address technical issues) on Tuesday, 16 August 2022. Google integrates new versions of the time zone database as they become available in a multi-step process involving several teams. It takes approximately one month for time zone database changes to roll out for Google Calendar.
[1] - https://www.iana.org/time-zones
Remediation
Google engineers expedited a roll out of the new time zone definitions on the morning of Wednesday, 07 September 2022 (local Chilean time). This had the following effects:
The current time in Calendar (the red bar) would be correct.
New events would appear at the correct time and be in the correct time zone.
Appointment schedules would appear at the correct time.
Modified recurring events would appear at the correct time, but instance-specific data (ie. attendee, attendee status, description, location, time, etc.) which did not match the timezone definition would be deleted and new instances would be created in the correct time zone.
Prevention
Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:
Implement improvements to the time zone updates rollout process that will reduce the lead time for completion.
Investigate Calendar interactions with other Workspace products with relation to mismatched time zones to minimize impact in case of a recurrence.
Detailed Description of Impact:
From 03 September 2022 21:00 to 07 September 2022 07:36 US/Pacific, Google Calendar events for all customers in Chile were impacted due to the time change event.
The customer impact included:
The current time in Calendar (the red bar) was out of sync with actual time and the operating system.
New and existing events were at the wrong time.
Appointments were set at the wrong time.
Appointments created across time zones displayed at the wrong time.
Updating appointment schedules displayed at the wrong time.
Mobile applications and devices displayed events at the wrong time.

MINI INCIDENT REPORT
We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Workspace Support using the help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.
(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 03 September 2022 21:00
Incident End:  07 September 2022 07:39
Duration:  3 days, 10 hours, 39 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Google Calendar
Regions/Zones: Chile
Description:
Google Calendar experienced an issue with a mismatch in daylight savings time in Chile. The issue was caused due to the decision of the Government of Chile to delay the time change by a week from 3 September 2022 to 10 September 2022.
Following the announcement of the Chilean Government’s decision on 8 August 2022, Google product teams evaluated options to minimize customer impact. After careful analysis, the Calendar product team decided to not roll out an ad-hoc fix due to the number of variables involved with the fix roll out. So, the Google team published an external blog post on 1 September 2022, outlining the Government’s decision to delay the time change and workarounds to prepare the customers in Chile for the best time change experience.
Upon receiving multiple customer escalations on 5 September 2022, the product team reconvened and decided to roll out the emergency fix to mitigate the impact to our customers.
Customer Impact:
Events  in the calendar for the week of 3 September 2022 to 10 September 2022 were not in the right time for users who have events saved in the Chilean time zone or if the user&#x27;s calendar is set to Chile time zone.
Current time displayed on the customers calendars is an hour later than the actual time.

On September 1st, 2022 from around 6:28 am to September 7th, 2022 around 3:00 pm PDT, some users on the Slack desktop app version 4.28.171 installed via the Windows Store were receiving an error when attempting to connect to Slack. 


We determined the cached information typically used to launch the app became corrupted, and subsequently caused the app to not load through a network request, prompting an error instead of re-trying the connection. We then launched a fix that allowed the app to re-attempt a network request, which solved the issue.</span>

                              <span>New!
  
Today, we are glad to announce yet a new feature: a brand new Dashboard section that will allow you to easily manage your daily tasks, directly from your Smily account.
Here is a sneak peek at what the new Dashboard looks like:

In the past, managing day to day operations may have been complicated. Tasks such as keeping track of payments, approving pending tentatives and others were time consuming.
Thanks to the Dashboard, you now have access to the following information:
List of pending tentatives: to help you convert them into confirmed bookings, or cancel them to free up the dates in your calendar
List of bookings with missing payments: to help you get all your payments on time and never miss a payment again
List of arrivals of the day: to help you plan the check-in of your guests
List of departures of the day: to help you plan the check-out of your guests
You can find more details in the dedicated manual article, and a video guided tour of the new Dashboard section will soon be added there as well.
We invite you to explore this new Dashboard, and hope it will help you save time and better manage your daily operations. Some improvements will also be made in the future, such as adding performance metrics to help you manage your business more easily.</span>

We traced this to a recent code change, which we reversed — resolving trouble for all affected users.</span>

From Monday August 29 at 10:11 AM PDT to Wednesday August 31st at 12:42 PM PDT, some Grid customers were running into errors when configuring SSO settings for their workspaces. Upon investigation, we identified an issue that was resulting in empty SAML configuration files. These empty files triggered the errors seen by users.


Removing the offending file fixed the issue for all affected users.</span>

From August 29, 2022 at 11:26 AM PDT to August 30, 2022 at 3:56 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced issues with their Mark as Read preferences, and intermittent issues loading channel history.


When you view a channel, Slack remembers your last scroll position so we can take you back to the same place. A recent feature update inadvertently bypassed the check for this scroll position, creating the impression that Slack wasn&#x27;t respecting your Mark as Read preference. Additionally, this incorrectly prevented channel history from loading for some users.


We identified the root cause and rolled this code change back, resolving the issue for all affected customers.</span>

On August 25, 2022 between 11:31 AM PDT and 12:37 PM PDT, some customers experienced trouble loading the Workflow Builder screen.


We traced the problem to a change in the front-end Workflow Builder components which prevented the Workflow Builder from starting up successfully. We reverted this, resolving the issue for all affected customers.</span>

From August 22, 2022 5:15 PM PDT to August 23, 2022 01:15 AM PDT, some customers experienced a persistent reload prompt when when their user account was converted from a member account to a guest account, even after a reload was completed.


A recent change made to our code resulted in the removal of a mechanism for indicating when a reload dialogue should appear. We have pushed a fix for this problem by reinstating the mechanism to ensure this only occurs for users once.</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:


On August 23, 2022 between 12:17 PM PDT and 1:32 PM PDT, some customers experienced difficulty with loading Slack and sending messages. This occurred when a group of database servers became overloaded and failed.


We first reduced the load on our infrastructure manually. The issue was then resolved when our automated processes kicked in, replacing the damaged server with a healthy one. While the issue is resolved, we will continue to investigate the root cause to avoid these problems in the future.</span>
