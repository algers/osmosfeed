Resolved - Due to an internal error that occurred from 12:28 PST 8/18 through 12:58 PST 8/23, malformed incoming multi-segment SMS messages were not logged. These messages are normally logged with Twilio error 30009:
- https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30009
The issue has now been resolved, and malformed incoming messages are now being logged.
Aug 23, 08:10 PDT
Monitoring - Our engineers are currently investigating the customer impact of a retroactive issue that affected logging of incoming messages.

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale client, combined with a behavior
of the UPnP implementations in some routers, could expose all UDP ports of a
node to external networks (usually the internet).
As of 2023-08-22 2:30 AM UTC, we have changed the Tailscale coordination server
to advise nodes to stop using UPnP for port mapping. In some cases this can
degrade NAT traversal and may cause some connections to route through DERP.
This may increase node-to-node latency and decrease throughput. Version 1.48.1
resolves the issue and re-enables port mapping via UPnP.
What happened?
Tailscale nodes use UPnP as one of the mechanisms to open UDP port forwarding
in routers to help with NAT traversal. Tailscale picks a node port and an
external router port and requests forwarding between them. On firs…</span>

On August 17, 2023 from 9:20 AM PDT to 9:37 AM PDT, some users encountered issues with messages not sending and channels and threads failing to load.


We determined that a recent indexing change caused a higher than expected level of requests to our database. The resulting high load errors were responsible for the impacted users&#x27; inability to load messages and channels.


We immediately reverted this change, which resolved the issue for affected users. We then deployed a fix to prevent this from reoccurring in the future.</span>

Identified - Our Engineering team identified an issue with VPC Connectivity for resources in our NYC3 region. 
Users creating new resources were not able to place them correctly into VPC&#x27;s in NYC3 via API create requests. Users also saw network connectivity errors between members of NYC3 VPC&#x27;s. This issue impacted Droplet-based products like Load Balances and Managed Kubernetes clusters as well, manifesting in various VPC-related errors.
Our team was able to mitigate this issue and we&#x27;re currently monitoring the situation. As of 00:00 UTC, users should see normal VPC behavior in NYC3. 
We apologize for the disruption and will post another update shortly.</span>

We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team for further review.

Update - Our Engineering team continues work on the rollout with the fix for Python builds failing in App Platform. 
We&#x27;ve identified that a very small number of Apps are impacted by this issue - less than 1% of users have encountered this issue. 
We will post an update once the rollout completes.

Identified - Our Engineering team has investigated and identified an issue impacting Python builds for App Platform. Beginning approximately 17:30 UTC, users will see the error &quot;Requested runtime &#x27;python-3.11.3&#x27; is not available for this stack (heroku-18)&quot;. 
The team is in the process of rolling out a fix. 
In the meantime as a workaround, users may update their Apps to use the Ubuntu 22.04-based stack. This stack is in beta, but provides dependency upgrades, and removes support for PHP version 8.0 and earlier. To update, users will need to specify the new stack in the app spec by adding: 
&quot;features:
    - buildpack-stack&#x3D;ubuntu-22&quot;
We will post another update once the fix has completed rolling out.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug 15, 18:02 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug 15, 17:06 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-15 18:00 UTC
End: 2023-08-15 22:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the FRA1 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug 14, 20:12 UTC
Update - Our Engineering team has completed the rollback and VPC connectivity for all Droplets and Droplet-based services is restored. 
We&#x27;ll now continue this maintenance as scheduled. 
We apologize for the brief interruption.
Aug 14, 20:03 UTC
Verifying - Our Engineering team has identified an issue stemming from this maintenance, which impacts approximately 1-3% of Droplets and Droplet-based services in our FRA1 region. 
At this time, a small percentage of customers will experience VPC network connectivity issues. An emergency rollback is already underway to mitigate this issue. 
We will update this post with further information as soon as possible.
Aug 14, 18:42 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug 14, 18:41 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-14 18:00 UTC
End: 2023-08-14 22:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the FRA1 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase. 
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

Resolved - From 23:16 - 04:00, updates to DigitalOcean Container Registry images were not displayed correctly in the UI (Cloud Control Panel), due to a lapsed internal authorization token. Our Engineering team was able to issue a new token and rolled out the change regionally in order to not disrupt multiple data planes at once. 
This issue is fully resolved. If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Aug 12, 03:54 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has confirmed the root cause of the issue with updates to the UI for DigitalOcean Container Registry and a fix is now rolling out regionally. 
As this rolls out, we expect users to once again be able to see updates to Container Registry images in the UI (Cloud Control Panel). 
We will post another update once the fix finishes rolling out in all regions.
Aug 12, 02:09 UTC
Identified - From 23:16 UTC, our Engineering team has identified an issue with DigitalOcean Container Registry and is actively working on a fix. During this time, customers will not be able to see changes on UI for new DOCR Images in multiple regions. We will post an update as soon as additional information is available.</span>

On August 9, 2023 from 9:00 AM PDT to August 10th 2023, 8:00 AM PDT, some Enterprise Grid users experienced a failure to redirect from browser to app during login - focus was moved to the app, but the sign in process did not complete.


We made a change to some logging functions and introduced a fix that mitigated the issue. This fix is permanent and will keep this issue from happening again.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug  9, 20:01 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug  6, 14:36 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-09 20:00 UTC
End:  2023-08-10 00:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SGP1 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase.
Expected impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of the issue impacting network connectivity in multiple regions. The impact has been completely subsided and the network connectivity is back to normal for all the impacted services. Users should now be able to process events normally for Droplets and Droplet-based services like Load Balancers, Kubernetes or Database clusters, etc.
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from your Cloud Control Panel.
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. Site performance should be back to normal.
Aug  7, 16:26 UTC
Monitoring - We&#x27;ve stopped a data migration job that is believed to be contributing, and we&#x27;re now seeing site latency return back to baseline numbers. The site latency should now be back to normal, but we are continuing to monitor.
Aug  7, 16:01 UTC
Investigating - There is degraded performance across the Rippling application, with certain pages loading slowly. We are investigating the issue.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On August 2, 2023 from 9:01 AM PDT to 11:00 AM PDT, customers may have experienced issues with blurry images in Slack, as well as trouble uploading files. A small percentage of customers may have also experienced errors or slowness when loading channels, sending messages, accessing admin pages, and connecting to Slack.


An issue with a routine database cluster migration inadvertently caused a decrease in capacity. Unfortunately, this coincided with a scheduled job to process a large number of custom status requests, an activity that commonly occurs at the top of each hour. The number of incoming requests exceeded the unintentionally reduced capacity of the database cluster, leading to errors and sluggishness for some actions in Slack. As these requests piled up, other Slack services began to experience issues as well, including a small number of users being unable to connect.


We paused the scheduled custom status job to immediately mitigate the load on the affected database cluster. This resolved some of the errors affecting Slack services. Once we established we had sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled job, we resumed processing the custom status requests, fully restoring normal service for all affected users.


Once the load was balanced and custom status processing had returned to normal, we deployed a fix to correct the issue with the database cluster migration, bringing capacity back to the expected level.</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:


From July 26th, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT to July 28th 2023 at 1:00PM PDT some users had trouble loading and editing canvases when accessing them from the channel canvas icon.


We determined this issue was caused by a recent code change related to how canvases persist across sessions. We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users. To see the fix applied, user impacted users should press Command/Control + R. We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.</span>

Resolved - [False alarm] This incident was a false alarm—the LOS Records API is working as expected. Apologies for the inconvenience.
Jul 28, 10:02 PDT
Identified - Starting today (July 28, 2023), we identified an issue affecting the LOS Records API. Records for 180 days from today (beyond Jan 24, 2024) are being ignored, and the dates are marked as unavailable on Airbnb, although requests to set those records are not failing. We are actively working to find the root cause, and mitigate this issue. We will post more information as soon as possible.</span>

On July 27, 2023 between 2:03 AM PDT - 2:59 AM PDT, Slack was experiencing a systemwide issue during which users were not able to send or receive messages across multiple platforms. 


Our engineering team identified an issue after a change was made to a service that manages our internal system communication. This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. 


We are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future. More information about remediation and prevention steps will be included in an upcoming RCA which you can request by writing into feedback@slack.com.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jul 27, 01:02 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jul 26, 23:08 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-27 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-27 05:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavour to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>

On July 25th, 2023 from 3:00 PM PDT to 6:00 PM PDT we received reports of existing members unable to invite new members to workspaces. We traced the cause of issue to a recent code change which prevented emails from being sent. This also impacted logins, workspace creation and potentially other email-based processes. We’ve reverted this change, and the issue was resolved for all customers.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jul 26, 01:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jul 25, 23:09 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-26 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-26 05:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase. 
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.</span>
