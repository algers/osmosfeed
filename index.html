On Friday, October 6 2023, from 1:52 AM PDT to 2:12 AM PDT, some users were unable to load Slack. This was caused by an issue where certain backend Slack processes were pulling data from our database rather than their cache which caused strain on our servers.


We rolled out a change to how these processes load data, and the issue was resolved for all users.</span>

On October 2, 2023 from 12:18PM PDT to 12:26PM PDT, some users noticed that threads were not loading correctly.


We identified a database issue on our backend that was causing the threads to not load. The issue was mitigated and users should no longer experience trouble loading threads.


We are investigating the cause of the database issue so we can ensure this does not happen again.


We apologize for any interruption to your work day!</span>

Resolved - From 14:44 UTC to 18:04 UTC we experienced another issue with our App Platform service related to CDN Insights for Apps in all regions. During this window, users might have observed blank graphs or no data for the CDN metrics including request counts, cache hit rates etc. Our engineering team was able to identify the problem and resolve it fully and as of 18:04 UTC all the metrics are displaying properly. 
The connectivity issue with the Apps for which we updated the status page earlier was only faced by a subset of users in FRA1 region, only between 12:45 UTC to 14:15 UTC. The normal functionality of apps was entirely restored around 14:15 UTC.
Thank you for your patience on this and if you continue to face issues then please open a support ticket from within the cloud control panel.</span>

On September 28, 2023 from approximately 11:54 AM PDT to 3:15 PM PDT, some Slack users experienced trouble receiving two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and therefore were unable to sign into Slack.


We determined this was caused by an upstream 2FA provider issue impacting code deliveries to US-based AT&amp;T and Verizon devices. We monitored communications from the provider and confirmed Slack users could successfully sign in once the upstream issue was resolved.</span>

From 8:00 AM PDT to 11:00 AM PDT on Thursday, September 28, 2023, a small number of users experienced delays in Slack, including sending and editing messages, and loading channels.


Upon investigation, we determined that a specific task in our backend was producing too many file deletion events and overloading our servers, resulting in these delays.


We implemented a fix to reduce the load on our servers and this resolved the issue for all affected users.</span>

We traced this back to a recent change that removed a function necessary for rendering a documentation page associated with the website. 


We reverted the change, restoring the documentation page rendering component on https://api.slack.com/apps. Users should no longer have issues creating or editing custom apps and accessing this website.

On September 26, 2023 from 10:00 AM PDT to 12:00 PM PDT, some users on our new interface design couldn&#x27;t dismiss an information prompt that read &quot;You now have Later&quot;. 


These users also experienced their UI locking, and were unable to click anything in the Slack app. For some, the sparkle animation fixed over the Later icon in the sidebar also persisted longer than intended. 


We identified the root cause as a missing detail in a recent code change. We reverted the change to mitigate the immediate issue, then deployed a fix to fully resolve the problem for all impacted users.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

Resolved - On September 27, 2023 at 00:12 UTC, our alerting systems detected an increase in the time it took GitHub Actions workflow runs to start. During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.
	We mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC. We have additional repair items in place to prevent a recurrence in the future.

                              <span>Issue summary: 

From 12:54 PM PDT on September 22, 2023 to 09:13 AM PDT on September 25, 2023, custom emoji rendered as text for a small number of Enterprise Grid users.


We made a code change that inadvertently introduced unnecessary logging for routine emoji events. This unexpected logging increased traffic to the custom emoji infrastructure, impacting its performance. 


We deployed a fix to remove the unnecessary logging, which reduced traffic to the custom emoji systems and restored normal emoji rendering. 


A small fraction of the affected customers may have experienced lingering issues as the fix was gradually rolled out to everyone.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

On September 21, 2023 from 8:00 PM PDT to 1:30 PM PDT, some users encountered a message stating &quot;Something went wrong&quot; when accessing the Slack Connect invites page.


We determined that rate limits set for querying invites were the cause of the &quot;Something went wrong&quot; message. These limits were set prior to the  product decision to include these in the Activity view. Because use of this view has increased, the limits are reached much sooner than originally expected.


These limits were lifted for the invites page, resolving the issue for users. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>

Resolved - On 2023-09-19 at 20:36 UTC, while migrating the primary datastore for Projects, we caused an outage that led to Projects data becoming unavailable for approximately four hours. 
While working to restore Projects data, we also experienced a data replication interruption which affected Git Operations, APIs, and Issues. We first resolved the data replication issue, which returned Git Operations, APIs, and Issues to normal operation. We then restored Projects data to its pre-migration state, and re-inserted data that was added during the period of partial availability. The incident was resolved on 2023-09-20 at 00:06 UTC.
As a result of this incident, we have improved validation of data migrations in test and during rollout.  We have also identified improvements to…</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

From September 6, 2023 at 2:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 8:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.


Note: Due to an internal tooling error, we initially reported the times in this summary in UTC, but labeled with PDT. We have corrected this mistake and apologize for any confusion caused.</span>
