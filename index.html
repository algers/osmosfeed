Incident Report
Summary
Starting on 17 April 2023 at 12:04, some Google Meet Hardware devices failed to launch the Meet app and the devices displayed a “Waiting for application window” message for a duration of 7 days, 19 hours and 34 minutes. To our Google Meet Hardware customers who were affected we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.
Root Cause
The device requires a healthy network state and a fully initialized Meet application in order to launch. When the affected devices started up after a reboot, certain conditions caused a network check to fail. Under these circumstances, the device displayed a “Waiting for application window” message indefinitely. Devices that were automatically upgraded to the next version of ChromeOS  were more susceptible to these conditions.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were able to identify a fix and deploy to the beta fleet of production on 21 April 2023 at 07:24 US/Pacific (within 24 hours of reproducing the issue). Google engineers instructed affected customers, who wanted to expedite receiving the fix, to move their devices to the Beta release channel. The incident was mitigated after the fix was released to the stable channel on 25 April 2023 at 07:38 US/Pacific.
We apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future, by completing the following actions :

Detailed Description of Impact
Beginning from 17 April 2023 at 12:04 US/Pacific, multiple customers of Google Meet Hardware devices, with Operating System (OS) versions greater than 14816.84.1 but lower than 14816.84.35, began to encounter issues in device startup following the upgrade.
At its peak, Google engineers were able to identify that around ~5000 devices had stopped, which caused the admins to receive an “offline device” alert for each of those devices.
These devices were frozen with “Waiting for application window” and would eventually go to sleep if left idle. The devices needed to be rebooted manually (sometimes with mitigation steps involving disconnecting the ethernet cable) or waiting for the device to reboot during a maintenance window.

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device
reauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to
lose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.
What happened?
The logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an
already-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the
device’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s
identity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without
any tags.
The bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on
2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.
Who is affected?
189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either
directly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast
user switching to switch between multiple
tailnets.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security
contacts.
What is the impact?
Devices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the
device’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,
or the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the
device. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab
of the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this
could change the device’s network permissions.
We have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of
deliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect
outcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.
What do I need to do?
If you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were
contacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the
admin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix
to the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected
organizations.</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On April 20th, 2023 from 6:00 AM PDT until 7:45 AM PDT, a small number of users experienced latency issues when using Slack. Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. 


The issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. 


Our team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this. We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:


On April 16rd, 2023 from 12:11 PM PDT until 14:39 PM PDT, certain Android users on the Free plan reported issues with loading channels in the Android app.  


Upon investigation, this was attributed to the implementation of a data optimization feature, intended to improve app performance. We have rolled back this feature temporarily, which has corrected the observed issue.  A full investigation and remedy will take place prior to reimplementation. 


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this.  We apologize for any disruption to your work.</span>

On April 10, 2023 at 7:30 PM PDT, some customers began experiencing delays when uploading files. We traced the issue back to a recent update made to how some file uploads are handled. Reverting this change fixed the issue, and customers were no longer experiencing it as of April 11, 2023 at 7:33 AM PDT.

Resolved - While we still await details from Twitter the only way how to create a connection at this moment is to have every user to create their own Twitter app at developer.twitter.com and use the apps API Key and API Key Secret to create a new connection in Make. We updated our documentation with details about how to obtain API Key and API Key Secret - https://www.make.com/en/help/apps/marketing/twitter#obtaining-api-key-and-api-key-secret-values-for-your-twitter-account
Apr  3, 23:56 CEST
Update - Twitter has suspended our app. We are continuing to investigate.
Apr  3, 21:29 CEST
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>
