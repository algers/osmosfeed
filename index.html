On June 30, 2023 from 8:12 AM PDT to 4:23 PM PDT, some users may have had trouble signing in to Slack with magic login codes or via the &#x27;Sign In With Email&#x27; button. 


A code change inadvertently introduced a logic error in the sign-in flow. We identified the error and deployed an initial fix to correct the flawed logic. This resolved the problem with the &#x27;Sign In With Email&#x27; button. After further investigation, we deployed a second correction to address the trouble with magic login codes, resolving the issue for all affected customers.


We believed the first fix had resolved the problem for all customers, and we updated the status site accordingly. However, we discovered that the issue with magic login codes had not been addressed, and we posted a separate notice on the status site while we investigated further. We apologize for any confusion and for calling the all clear too quickly. 


We have updated the titles for both entries so that they match.</span>

From 00:00 AM PDT on Saturday, June 24th, 2023 to Monday, June 26th, 2023 10:18 AM PDT, some users on the desktop and browser apps encountered a &#x27;failed to send&#x27; error message when trying to send messages with files attached. 


The issue was caused by a recent change to how file permissions are read when files are shared. This change was reverted, which resolved the problem for impacted users. 


Our team is making efforts to prevent issues like this from reoccurring in the future. Thank you for your patience while we sorted out this issue.</span>

Incident Report
Summary
From 7 June 2023 at 13:00 to 13 June 2023 at 10:50 US/Pacific, Google Sheets users experienced issues fetching finance data using the built-in GOOGLEFINANCE() function. The total impact duration lasted 5 days, 21 hours, 50 minutes.
Root Cause
Google engineers identified a configuration change that unintentionally triggered this issue during a recent rollout. The change caused requests to return an “N/A” value, which ultimately impacted Sheets end users&#x27; ability to fetch data using the built-in function.
Remediation and Prevention
An internal user alerted Google engineers to the issue on 13 June 2023 at 03:35 US/Pacific. Google engineers quickly identified the change that was deployed to a backend component. To mitigate the issue, engineers rolled back the change, and services were fully restored 13 June 2023 at 10:50 US/Pacific.
Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Extend our monitoring capabilities to identify similar issues faster.
Optimize our debugging tools to enable us to investigate similar issues faster.
Validate our test suite to ensure similar issues are eliminated before being deployed to production systems.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed that the issue impacting our Functions service has been fully resolved. If you continue to experience any issues in relation to this incident please open a ticket with our support team. Thank you for your patience.
Jun 21, 17:11 UTC
Monitoring - Functions in BLR1 region are now restored to normal service. As of 17:00 UTC, all impact has been mitigated and users should no longer experience any issues with the Functions. We are monitoring the situation and will post an update once the incident is completely resolved.
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Jun 21, 16:50 UTC
Update - Functions in FRA1 and LON1 are now restored to normal service. We continue work to remediate BLR1.
Our Engineering team has discovered that some Function invocations were duplicated, so a subset of users may have experienced that during the course of this incident.
We will post an update once the last region has returned to normal service.
Jun 21, 16:01 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has been working in order to restore the Functions service. At this time, normal service has been restored in most of the regions including AMS3, SGP1, TOR1, and SYD1.
We’re now working to fully remediate the remaining regions: BLR1, FRA1, and LON1. We will post an update as soon as that has completed. Thank you for your patience!
Jun 21, 15:43 UTC
Investigating - Beginning 14:37 UTC, our Engineering team has identified an issue impacting Functions in AMS3, BLR1, FRA1, LON1, SGP1, SYD1, and TOR1. During this time, users with standalone Functions or Functions deployed through Apps may experience performance degradation, leading to delays in Functions invocations and/or Functions working more slowly than normal.
Our team is working to mitigate the issue and we will provide an update as soon as possible.</span>

Resolved - From 12:00 - 13:40 UTC our Engineering team observed an issue with network connectivity to US-EAST-1 and US-EAST-2 (AWS) from European datacenter regions including DigitalOcean&#x27;s AMS, FRA &amp; LON datatancers. During this time, a subset of users might have experienced high latency or errors while connecting to  services, including Droplets and Droplet-based products. We also received reports of issues in pushing/pulling images to and from DigitalOcean Container Registries. 
As of 13:40 UTC the impact has been subsided and users should no longer be facing network connectivity issues. We apologize for the inconcenience and if you are still experiencing issues or have any additional questions then please open a support ticket from within your account.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. We have restored the correct bedroom, bathroom and bed count on the Listings API.
Jun 15, 20:37 PDT
Update - We have implemented a fix to restore the correct bedrooms, bathrooms and bed values on the Listings API and will continue to monitor this incident.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we resolve this issue.
Jun 15, 14:38 PDT
Monitoring - We are currently addressing a bug that affects the bedroom, bathroom, and bed count on our Listings API. Due to a change in behavior of how bedrooms, bathrooms and beds interact with the Listing Rooms API, you might come across the following issues:
* On the Listings API, some listings might have the fields &#x60;bedrooms&#x60;,&#x60;bathrooms&#x60; and/or &#x60;beds&#x60; set to 0.
* On the Listings Rooms API, some rooms might have been created/deleted.
As of today, we have reverted the problematic behavior and are working diligently to restore the correct bedrooms, bathrooms, and beds values on the Listings API. To ensure that your Listing Rooms are accurately set, we kindly ask you to re-sync your data.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we resolve this issue.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. However, there remains a minor possibility that reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks may be sent without the guest&#x27;s last name due to an Airbnb race condition. In case you encounter this issue, please  you can retrieve the missing information with the GET Reservations API.
We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, or require further assistance.
Jun 14, 16:46 PDT
Identified - Unfortunately, the mitigation did not resolve the issue and we are still seeing reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks missing the guest last name. Please know our engineering teams are working to get this issue resolved, and we will update you with the latest information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, please use the GET reservations API for any reservations that did not include the guest last name within the webhooks. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Jun 12, 08:41 PDT
Monitoring - We have implemented a fix for this issue and are monitoring the results. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
Jun  9, 00:12 PDT
Identified - The issue has been identified and we are working on a fix.
Meanwhile, please attempt GET reservations requests for any reservations that did not include the guest names in full within the webhooks.
Jun  8, 19:36 PDT
Investigating - We are currently investigating an issue where guest names are not returned in full within webhooks - namely the reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks. This is not a widespread issue and is only affecting a small percentage of webhooks.
Alternatively, you may be able to retrieve the details with GET reservations requests.
We will post updates as soon as we know more.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.</span>

In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jun 12, 11:00 PDT
Scheduled - The deprecation date for API Webhook Version 2021.12.31 was May 31, 2023. Any applications that have not fully migrated webhooks will be automatically migrated to a newer version, which can result in application breakage.
Automatic webhook migration will occur in phases as detailed in https://developer.airbnb.com/docs/versioning-enforcement
Phase 1 will occur during the week of June 12th, 2023 and will automatically migrate all async webhooks (except Messaging, Reviews and Reservations).</span>

Resolved - From 19:12 - 19:40 UTC, we experienced an issue with Volumes and Snapshots endpoints. During that time, we saw elevated 500 errors and a subset of users experienced latency or errors while loading the Volumes or Images tab in the Cloud Control Panel. A subset of users also experienced errors in both the Cloud Control Panel and the API for CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on Volumes and Snapshots. 
Our Engineering team was able to identify the root cause and quickly deployed a configuration fix to resolve the situation.  
We apologize for the inconvenience. If you are still experiencing any problems or have additional questions, please open a support ticket within your account.</span>

From June 13, 2023 at 12:30 PM PDT until June 15, 2023 at 2:30 AM PDT, some users may have experienced issues with statuses, reminders and agendas failing to sync from their Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar apps.


These issues were due to an outage from an upstream service provider which affected many services. The provider actively worked to remediate those issues, which then fully resolved the reported failures for impacted Slack users.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the full resolution of the issue impacting networking in our European regions.
From 16:40 UTC to 02:10 UTC, Users may have experienced network timeouts, packet loss, and/or increased latency interacting with the resources in these regions (AMS2/3, FRA1 &amp; LON1).
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Jun 15, 02:40 UTC
Monitoring - The network issues affecting our European regions have been mitigated. Users should no longer experience packet loss/latency, timeouts, and related issues with Droplet-based services in those regions, including Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Managed Database.
We will continue to monitor network conditions for a period of time to establish a return to pre-incident conditions.
Jun 15, 01:26 UTC
Update - Our engineering team continues to investigate the ongoing issues impacting the networking in our European data centres including AMS2/3, FRA1 &amp; LON1 regions. During this time, you may experience intermittent packet loss or increased latency while interacting with the resources in these regions. We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.

Investigating - From 16:40 UTC our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting the networking in our European data centers including AMS2/3, FRA1 &amp; LON1 regions. During this time, you may experience intermittent packet loss or increased latency while interacting with the resources in these regions.
At the moment, all the droplet-based services appear to be impacted and the users can expect to see brief connectivity issues and interrupted traffic flows. This will also be impacting services including Spaces and Managed Databases. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

On June 13, 2023 from 11:55 AM PDT to around 3:47 PM PDT, some users may have experienced failure with clips transcribing and transcoding, execution of workflows with custom functions, new deployments of apps with hosted functions, and some delay when using canvases in Slack. 


These issues were due to an outage from an upstream service provider which affected many services. The provider actively worked to remediate those issues, which then fully resolved the reported failures for impacted Slack users.</span>

Identified - We&#x27;re currently experiencing an issue that appears only in certain unique circumstances when a running scenario is not properly using the values of team or organization variables during executions.
Specific circumstances for the issue are:
- A team or organization variable is used as a filter condition OR there is more than one team or organization variable referenced within a single mapped field, OR the variable is used inside a function.
- AND the scenario was created / modified before March 8, 2023 
- AND the execution occurs after May 3, 2023
Workaround: 
Any user encountering this issue can open the affected scenario, make any change (move a module) and hit save. This will immediately resolve the issue for that scenario.
Complete resolution: 
The development team is actively working on a fix that will address any scenario where the issue still persists. Will post an update once we have more information around the permanent fix.

Resolved - Notion was down from around 9:25am - 9:40am Pacific time.  We are still investigating an issue that may be preventing some users from accessing notion.so while not logged in.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:


On June 02, 2023 from 3:28 PM PDT to around 5:29 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced large empty spaces in the Workflow Builder UI and issues with publishing/adding or editing steps in a workflow. 


We traced the issue to a recent code change which caused the channel selector to appear out of view, resulting in the inability to take certain actions while editing a workflow. 


We reverted the change which solved the issue for all customers.</span>
