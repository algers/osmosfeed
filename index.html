No action is needed to restore console access for Droplets created during this incident. 
If you continue to see issues, please contact our support team for assistance.

Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with Droplet console access for new Debian and Ubuntu Droplets. 
Any new Droplets created using Debian or Ubuntu operating systems will not have access to the Droplet console. This impacts only the standard Droplet console - the recovery console will still function normally.  
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Full Incident Report
SUMMARY:
On Friday, 16 September at 10:23 US/Pacific, Cloud Support Systems, which utilizes a 3rd party product, experienced row-lock errors while updating cases. This preventedSupport agents from being able to update or make changes to some Support cases. Additionally, the send email to customers action was unavailable for some Support cases. Some customers may have seen an error when updating cases from the customer portal. As a workaround, customers and Support agents could successfully update their cases by retrying the action. The issue was mitigated at 17:27 US/Pacific and service was fully restored for both the Support agents and customers. The total duration of the service disruption was 7 hours and 4 minutes.
ROOT CAUSE:
Cloud Support Systems experienced a large backlog of case field update actions pending in the SLO timed actions queue. These timed actions were running in large batches, with updates running in the queue every few minutes. This caused the cases to be locked down from any other update actions while that job was running.
This backlog was caused by the following:
There was an increase in the limit of cases being processed every hour by the SLO time queue job.
There was a rollback issue with the 3rd party product while processing time based tasks which caused multiple processing requests of the same tasks.
There was a configuration in the case trigger which created a backlog on large batches which triggered the above bug with the 3rd party product.
REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:
Our engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal support agent&#x27;s case on Monday, 12 September 2022. Engineering began investigating and working on a solution. On Tuesday, September 13 there was one report of external impact. The issue progressed and impact became visible externally on Friday, 16 September 2022 at 10:23 US/Pacific, and the row lock issue was confirmed to have widespread external impact. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers filed a case with the 3rd party product support to address the issue with Cloud Systems. The  backlog actions were purged manually using the 3rd party setup UI which brought the backlog in the queue down by 80%, the issue was completely resolved for the end user on Friday, 16 September at 17:27 US/Pacific.
Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:
Implement a code enhancement with the 3rd party vendor to confirm the error handling code which triggered the issue is fixed.

As you may know, we were pleased to participate in the Vacation Rental World Summit in Porto last week as a Gold Sponsor !
This was the 6th edition of this event, which is becoming increasingly popular each year.
It provides an opportunity for us to meet our partners and customers. We are also always happy and curious to get to know new players in our amazing industry.
These shared moments exchanging with lots of different actors allow us to stay informed about trends and activity in the vacation rental industry.

This year again, this event dedicated to vacation rentals has boosted our collaboration with, among others, our official partners!
At Smily, the quality of our partnerships matters a lot. We want to offer our customers the smoothest integrations and the best assistance we can, from us and from our partners.
We thank our partners who were present at VRWS a lot for the quality of our discussions and their enthusiasm towards our collaboration! :)

Identified - We have identified an issue affecting the sending of reservation related webhooks starting on September 15th, we are actively working on it and will post more updates when we have them. This incident does not affect all reservations, only a limited number of them. If you notice that some of your Hosts&#x27; reservations webhooks are missing, for example when you accept a make_reservation SAC, but you did not receive a confirmation webhook afterwards, use the GET reservations API to retrieve the reservation status.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:


Starting September 6th, 2022, we identified an issue with the Google Sheet app inside Workflow Builder. This issue caused the app to read the spreadsheet date/time format wrong, inserting the incorrect time value in the timestamp.


We discovered this was due to the app processing the workflow step with a single digit value instead of a double digit value.


Users can continue highlighting the Submission Time column in the spreadsheet and select Format → Number → Custom Number Format and insert: ddd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss, as a workaround.


We will work to fix this through a bug ticket that has been filed as a result of this incident. Though we have not resolved this issue yet, we will provide further updates through customer support tickets with the impacted users.</span>

On September 1st, 2022 from around 6:28 am to September 7th, 2022 around 3:00 pm PDT, some users on the Slack desktop app version 4.28.171 installed via the Windows Store were receiving an error when attempting to connect to Slack. 


We determined the cached information typically used to launch the app became corrupted, and subsequently caused the app to not load through a network request, prompting an error instead of re-trying the connection. We then launched a fix that allowed the app to re-attempt a network request, which solved the issue.</span>

                              <span>New!
  
Today, we are glad to announce yet a new feature: a brand new Dashboard section that will allow you to easily manage your daily tasks, directly from your Smily account.
Here is a sneak peek at what the new Dashboard looks like:

In the past, managing day to day operations may have been complicated. Tasks such as keeping track of payments, approving pending tentatives and others were time consuming.
Thanks to the Dashboard, you now have access to the following information:
List of pending tentatives: to help you convert them into confirmed bookings, or cancel them to free up the dates in your calendar
List of bookings with missing payments: to help you get all your payments on time and never miss a payment again
List of arrivals of the day: to help you plan the check-in of your guests
List of departures of the day: to help you plan the check-out of your guests
You can find more details in the dedicated manual article, and a video guided tour of the new Dashboard section will soon be added there as well.
We invite you to explore this new Dashboard, and hope it will help you save time and better manage your daily operations. Some improvements will also be made in the future, such as adding performance metrics to help you manage your business more easily.</span>

From Monday August 29 at 10:11 AM PDT to Wednesday August 31st at 12:42 PM PDT, some Grid customers were running into errors when configuring SSO settings for their workspaces. Upon investigation, we identified an issue that was resulting in empty SAML configuration files. These empty files triggered the errors seen by users.


Removing the offending file fixed the issue for all affected users.</span>

From August 29, 2022 at 11:26 AM PDT to August 30, 2022 at 3:56 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced issues with their Mark as Read preferences, and intermittent issues loading channel history.


When you view a channel, Slack remembers your last scroll position so we can take you back to the same place. A recent feature update inadvertently bypassed the check for this scroll position, creating the impression that Slack wasn&#x27;t respecting your Mark as Read preference. Additionally, this incorrectly prevented channel history from loading for some users.


We identified the root cause and rolled this code change back, resolving the issue for all affected customers.</span>
