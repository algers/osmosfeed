Incident Report
Summary
On Monday, 12 December 2022 at 21:30 US/Pacific, some Google Meet users experienced issues joining livestreams globally for a duration of 12 hours and 20 minutes. The issue did not impact iOS users of Meet. To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have conducted an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the resiliency of our service.
Root Cause
Google Meet livestream allows Meet customers to stream meetings to a large number of viewers. It relies on the YouTube streaming infrastructure and the YouTube player to view livestreams in the browser.
The trigger of the incident was a recent software update, which introduced an issue that resulted in the video player failing to recognize Meet livestreams and failing to start live playbacks. The change was initially pushed to 1% of users, and after monitoring for a period of time with no issues observed, Google engineers followed established practices and pushed the change to 100% of users in production.
Errors that occurred during this period, however, were missed during the initial rollout, because our monitoring did not properly incorporate signals from Meet&#x27;s player. Once the change was pushed to 100%, the issue&#x27;s frequency increased. The errors that occurred due to the change also led to additional internal API traffic due to retry behaviors, which overloaded our servers.
Remediation and Prevention
Google engineers were notified of the issue through a customer support case on Tuesday, 13 December at 03:12 US/Pacific and immediately began an investigation. Once the scope of the issue became clear, the incident was escalated at 04:53. The incident was further escalated to the YouTube team at 07:44. At 09:20, the root cause was identified, and engineers initiated a rollback of the software update. The incident was fully mitigated at 09:50, once the rollback completed.
Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:
Implement a fix for the video player retry loop in the Meet player to prevent request overload.
Implement monitoring and alerting to detect failures to connect to livestreams in Meet and reduce mitigation time for issues of this type.
Investigate an alternative live streaming platform for Meet and remove dependency on YouTube.
Enhance testing in the staging environment to identify and prevent regressions before rollout progresses.
Detailed Description of Impact
On Monday, 12 December 2022 from 21:30 to Tuesday, 13 December at 09:50 PT, some Google Meet users experienced issues joining livestreams globally.
Google Meet
Android and Web Google Meet clients experienced errors, which resulted in a retry loop behavior for the Meet broadcast players.
Some users would continue to see the error after the rollback completed, as a browser refresh would be required.

From Monday December 12, 2022 at 10:27 AM PST to Monday December 19, 2022 at 1:30 PM PST, we began investigating reports of messages being marked as read when backgrounding the iOS app while in a conversation. As a result, the sidebar would not show unread messages next to the DM/Channel/Threads view. 


We have now made a change on our end that resolved the issue and released a fix on iOS app version 22.12.21. Users on the iOS app should now be able to receive messages without them being marked as read automatically.</span>

We determined this issue was caused by a recent frontend change that caused a failure to load videos via the streaming protocol HLS (Hypertext Live Streaming), for which no fallback existed. 


To resolve this issue, we introduced a fallback to HLS allowing users to play video files with a slightly degraded experience, such as longer load times. 


Additionally, we disabled a code optimization technique which fully restored HLS functionality for all users.</span>

From December 14, 2022 at 04:30 PST to December 14, 2022 at 09:00 PST, we received reports from customers who were unable to receive SMS 2FA codes to login, we discovered that the Slack Twilio queue on the Twilio services was growing at a high rate and the outgoing SMS message error rate began to grow. Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. It was discovered that a majority of this traffic was coming from nefarious acting workspaces issuing too many app download link SMS requests to the Twilio service. With thousands of workspaces doing this at the same time, our queue became overloaded. The disposable email domains used to create these teams were added to a Total Ban blocklist preventing any users using the domains from accessing Slack — stopping team creation and further SMS pumping. Twilio was also able to drop the messages specific to app download links based on a content filter. With these actions, the queue was able to catch back up.</span>

From 10:12 AM PST until 10:25 AM PST on December 14, 2022, some customers had trouble loading Slack workspaces, sending messages, and uploading files.


Prior to this issue, we began removing traffic from an isolated location within a data center region as part of a planned exercise. Upon further investigation, we identified a bug within this process. We then stopped the process, which resolved the issue for all users. Error rates were monitored for a short while prior to announcing the resolution, in order to ensure the issue was fully resolved and would not reoccur.</span>

From December 8, 2022 at 03:15 PST to December 8, 2022 at 05:10 PST, some customers may have experienced issues with exports failing. This was due to a lack of disk space on one of the hosts running export jobs. We fixed this issue by terminating the host which resolved the problem for all affected customers.</span>

On December 4, 2022, from 5:00 PM PST to 11:14 PM, users ran into trouble where they did not receive 2FA codes on SMS, making them unable to log into Slack as a result. This issue was due to a service provider&#x27;s slow processing rate.


To fix this, we sorted out the processing backlog together with the service provider. We then had them raise the country specific processing rate limit, resolving the issue for our customers.</span>
