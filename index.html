Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 24, 16:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 24, 15:05 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-24 16:00 UTC
End:  2023-05-24 20:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. This will be the final phase of the three maintenance activities performed by our team in AMS3 on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Update - Our Engineering team has detected large amounts of loss and latency on network routes between NYC/TOR and Singapore. Users may experience higher-than-normal latency or amounts of packet loss for traffic traversing those routes. The team is reviewing any possible traffic shifts to alleviate the situation. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please open a support ticket from within your account.

Update - Our Engineering team detected large amounts of loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and Frankfurt, from 13:10 - 13:20 UTC, today. The issue self-recovered, likely due to upstream providers shuffling traffic. 
Additionally, our team is seeing high levels of loss and latency on network routes between Bangalore and Sydney. Users m…</span>

Our investigation uncovered that a recent code change we made had caused an overwhelming impact on our databases. We rolled this change back and temporarily redirected user traffic as our databases recovered. Once we rolled back the change and our databases were in a healthier state, the issue became resolved for impacted users.


We will continue to implement new ways to detect issues like this early-on.

On May 23, 2023 from 5:30 PM PDT to around 8:15 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced blank profile pictures, display names, channel names, and emoji in Slack.


A code change inadvertently altered the firewall rules for some of our regional servers, preventing the Slack clients connected to these regions from loading profile and channel elements as expected.


As an immediate mitigation step, we stopped the code change from rolling out any further, and pushed all traffic from the affected servers to other regions. This resolved the issue for impacted customers. 


We then reverted the code change and manually restored the correct firewall rules on the affected servers. Once the correct rules were back in place, we reintroduced traffic to these regions, fully resolving the issue.</span>

                              <span>On May 23, 2023 from around 7:00 PM to 10:37 PM PDT, some users located in Indonesia may have experienced connectivity issues with Slack. 


We investigated, and determined that a local Internet service provider (ISP) is not resolving Slack domains as expected. 


If you&#x27;re having trouble connecting to Slack, please reach out to your ISP for assistance.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 23, 16:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 23, 15:20 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-23 16:00 UTC
End: 2023-05-23 20:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. This will be the second of three maintenance activities performed by our team in AMS3 on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Resolved - We have identified and fixed an issue related to missing PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE standard fee that occurred between 13:54 PDT May 17th until 17:07 PDT May 18th 2023. 
The issue caused standard fee PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE to be cleared and as a result some reservations might be missing the cleaning fee. 
Please reapply the Standard Fees by making PUT pricing_settings requests with the desired fees.
This should re-populate the listings&#x27; Standard Fees array as intended, namely the PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE.
If you have any further queries related to this incident, please submit a ticket via the Partner Support Portal and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From 12:24 - 13:26 UTC, we experienced an issue that impacted our DNS API services. During this time, customer deployments to App Platform will have failed to process, and managing domains and DNS records through both the Cloud Control Panel and API would have been unavailable. 
If you continue to experience problems with either of these services please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel. Thank you for your patience.

Monitoring - Our Engineering team identified that the root cause of the issues impacting App Platform deployments was a wider issue involving our DNS API. Along with the App Platform deployment errors, customers would have experienced trouble viewing and editing domains and their DNS records through both the Cloud Control Panel and the API. 
A fix has been rolled out and as of 13:26 UTC customers should no longer be experiencing any issues involving the services listed above. Our team will continue to monitor the situation to ensure stability and provide a final update as soon as we confirm the issue has been fully resolved. 
Thank you for your patience.
May 20, 12:46 UTC
Investigating - As of 12:24 UTC, Our Engineering team is investigating a global issue with our App Platform service. During this time, users may experience issues while performing any operations for new, updated and deleting deployments. 
At this time, previously deployed running Apps are not impacted. We will provide an update as soon as possible.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 16, 22:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.

Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-16 22:00 UTC
End: 2023-05-17 02:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the NYC2 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer network traffic due to this maintenance. 
Should an unexpected issue arise, a possible outcome would be a failure of control plane events, including, but not limited to, Droplet and Droplet-based service creates, Snapshots, Backups, etc. Should this failure occur, we will update this post with further details.

Mini Incident Report
We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support  or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.
(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 5 May 2023 12:02
Incident End: 5 May 2023 12:58
Duration: 56 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Gmail, Google Cloud Networking
Regions/Zones: Multi Region Europe
Description:
Multiple Google services, including GCP and Workspace, experienced an outage for a duration of up to 56 minutes in and around Spain/Morocco. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a Google initiated network routing change at the edge of our network there. The issue was mitigated at 12:58 by removing the problematic routers from service, forcing traffic to use other paths.
Customer Impact:
GCP
Google Cloud Networking experienced a full outage for all internet service providers (ISPs) connected to two peering routers in Madrid, Spain.
All GCP services were unavailable for users reaching GCP from impacted ISP(s) until mitigation in and around Spain/Morocco.
Workspace
Some Gmail customers had delivery delays and availability issues during the outage in Spain.
If your service or application was affected, we apologize — this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have taken and are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.

Resolved - Impact: minor;
Our upstream provider will continue to work to fully resolve this issue, but at this time, we have not been provided an ETA. Until we receive communication from them, traffic will remain shifted away to alternate providers to mitigate user impact. 
Due to this, we will go ahead and close out this incident. The traffic shift to reintroduce upstream providers, when it occurs, should be seamless for users in the SFO regions. 
If you have any questions or concerns about this or continue to experience network connectivity issues, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
Reports show that from approximately 20:00 UTC on May 8th to 02:30 UTC on May 9th, DNS resolution was inoperative for services in our SFO1 region. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel.
Resolved: May 09, 2023 - 03:42 UTC
-
Our Engineering team identified an issue with the path that resolver traffic was taking for our SFO1 region, resulting in services in SFO1 being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. A fix has been put in place and we&#x27;ve confirmed that DNS resolution is now functioning normally.
We&#x27;re now monitoring the situation and will post an update shortly once we confirm full resolution of this incident.
Monitoring: May 09, 2023 - 02:49 UTC
-
Our Engineering team is investigating user reports of services in our SFO1 region being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. This includes running commands on Droplets that utilize DNS lookups, such as &quot;wget&quot; and &quot;apt update&quot;, etc. Inbound network connections to services should still be operating normally. 
Thank you for your patience as our team works to understand the root cause of the issue. We&#x27;ll post an update once we have further information.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has continued to actively monitor the situation resulting from multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. Over the last ten days, network connectivity on routes from Singapore to San Francisco and Singapore to Europe has not experienced any major packet loss or latency. Network routes to and from Bangalore also have not experienced any major packet loss or latency. Crews have been able to complete some cable repairs, leading to the stability for the routes mentioned. 
Our team is still observing daily packet loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and New York City, as well as Singapore and Toronto. These are normally short-lived and happen during Singapore business hours when traffic is heavy.

                              <span>Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device
reauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to
lose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.
What happened?
The logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an
already-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the
device’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s
identity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without
any tags.
The bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on
2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.
Who is affected?
189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either
directly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast
user switching to switch between multiple
tailnets.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security
contacts.
What is the impact?
Devices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the
device’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,
or the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the
device. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab
of the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this
could change the device’s network permissions.
We have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of
deliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect
outcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.
What do I need to do?
If you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were
contacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the
admin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix
to the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected
organizations.</span>
