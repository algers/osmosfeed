From Tuesday, February 14th, 2023 at 09:52 AM PST until Tuesday, February 21st, 2023 at 08:56 AM PST, some enterprise customers experienced issues with the delivery of mobile notifications on Android devices.

From February 14th, 2023 at 10:49AM PST until February 20th, 2023 at 1:16 AM PST some customers were unable to load their workspace&#x27;s admin page. We traced this issue to a recent code change, which resulted in the workspace token being invalidated when visiting the admin page from a browser. Reverting this code change fixed the issue for all affected customers.</span>

On Tuesday February 14th, 2023 from 1:19 AM PST to 3:50 AM PST some customers reported an issue where the API method files.upload created a new message instead of uploading files in a thread.


Our team identified that the cause of the issue was linked to a recent update. This change was rolled back which fixed the issue.

On Monday February 13th, 2023 at 07:00PM to Tuesday February 14th, 2023 at 01:02 AM PST, customers were unable to view threads in public channels they had not joined. This was caused by a recent code change - we&#x27;ve deployed a correction to this and the issue is now resolved.


Should customers continue to experience this behaviour, a hard refresh of the Slack client will fix this.</span>

Resolved - Engineering has implemented mitigations, which should have resolved performance issues. We’ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we run into issues again.
We found that page analytics events, such as page views and page edits, did not save during the time of this incident. Impacted users may see their page related analytics as undercounted for February 13, 2023. Our team is looking into how we can prevent this from happening in the future. We appreciate your patience while we work on making these improvements.
Feb 13, 08:17 PST
Investigating - Notion users may experience general performance slowness. Engineering is currently investigating and implementing mitigations.</span>

Sounds impossible to find a guest message in seconds ? 
As we keep improving our features, we work closely with property users and managers like yourself to learn how we can help you run your business more efficiently. 
After several workshops, reflections, and feedback, our Smily team did several adjustments to help you use our centralized Inbox in order to simplify this daily communication.
We added several filters to help you find the conversations easily in the Inbox, you can now filter by the following criterias:
Conversation status
Assignee
Guest
Booking stage
Booking status
Rental
Booking tag
Rental tag

This way you can find the exact conversation you are looking for in a matter of seconds :) 
For more details please see the article from our manual
Wishing you all a pleasant day!</span>

On January 31, 2023 from 11:40 AM PST to 11:55 AM PST, customers may have experienced issues with workflows not running as expected or posting duplicate messages. 


A network event prevented access to some of the database servers that support workflows. This disruption meant that the remaining servers were unable to handle the workflow load. 


We restarted the affected servers and manually increased the capacity to resolve the issue, restoring normal workflow behaviour.</span>

On January 31, 2023 from 9:44 AM to 3:17 PM PST, some customers may have experienced issues creating new workspaces. 


An error in our onboarding flow meant we were incorrectly assuming new workspaces had completed the onboarding process before any onboarding actually took place, leaving these newly created workspaces in an unusable limbo state. We reverted the change that caused the initial onboarding inconsistencies, then released a fix to resolve some dependencies from the reverted file. 


Everyone should be able to create new workspaces as normal once again, although you may experience some overzealous onboarding prompts as the system resolves any lingering inconsistencies.</span>
