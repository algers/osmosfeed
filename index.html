Resolved - Engineers have concluded that the provisioning delay with the carrier will continue to be an ongoing issue. The wait time has improved since opening this issue, but on average the expected delay could be approximately 10 days for provisioning changes to take effect on the carrier side.
This delay may cause message delivery issues to and from T-Mobile subscribers for newly provisioned and deprovisioned lines. 
We will be closing this incident, but please be aware of the above details moving forward. Thank you for your patience with this investigation.

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On July 13, 2023 between 12:19 PM PDT and 12:36 PM PDT, some users encountered errors which led to being unable to load threads, send DMs, joining channels, and accessing Slack overall.


This issue was a result of a failed host in our database infrastructure. We quickly replaced this host, fixing the problem for all impacted users.


Users should no longer be experiencing any trouble accessing Slack.</span>

Resolved - We have backfilled message threads for the reservations that were affected during this time window. You should now be able to retrieve the &#x60;thread_id&#x60; associated with a reservation using the Reservations API. Apologies for the inconvenience.
If you have any further queries related to this incident, please submit a ticket via the Partner Support Portal and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
Jul 12, 12:25 PDT
Identified - We have identified an issue that caused reservations to be created without associated threads. This occurred between 10:15 PM and 11:29 PM on July 12th (PST), so notifications for reservations created during that time were sent with a null &#x60;thread_id&#x60; value.
We are actively working on creating threads for reservations that do not have them, and will update here afterwards.
Once this is done, you will be able to retrieve the &#x60;thread_id&#x60; value for a reservation using the Reservations API.</span>

Description:
All Google Meet group calling users experienced degraded audio quality for a duration of 7 days, 1 hour and 5 minutes. During this time, customers were unable to understand the audio.

We would like to inform you that we will deploy a nice improvement to your websites.
Starting today, all Smily websites will be under SSL certificates.
There is nothing you have to do on your side, this change will be automatic and shall not impact your website’s accessibility.
What does it mean ?
Your website’s URL will be starting with https:// and no longer http://.
What are the benefits of this change ?
Websites are more secured
Better user experience
Users stay longer and buy more on secured websites
Sites with HTTPS load faster
HTTPS leads to accurate SEO reporting
Better SEO : SSL is a positive ranking factor for Google. Google’s team has expressed the need for HTTPS time and time again. So much so that they’ve released an algorithm update based on it—causing sites without HTTPS security to struggle on their quest to rank highly in the search engines results.
Feel free to reach out to us if you have any question !</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On July 6, 2023 between 06:21 AM PDT and 10:58 AM PDT, some users were experiencing issues with messages sent with an attached file and app mention. They were incorrectly displaying an error &quot;This message contains interactive elements&quot;.


As we looked into it further, we traced the problem to a formatting issue, which resulted in missing metadata for the messages sent. Reverting a recent change fixed the issue for all affected customers.</span>

Hello, 
During the above window, our Engineering team will be performing maintenance on redundant upstream electrical systems in order to improve reliability in our FRA1 region.
Expected Impact:
We don&#x27;t expect to see any downtime as the power to hypervisors are redundant. In a highly unlikely situation, where we lose power to both the supplies, the Droplets in FRA1 may experience downtime for a brief period. We will endeavor to keep this to a minimum for the duration of the change.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket
Thank you,

On Wednesday June 28th, 2023 from 10:35 AM PDT to 1:55 PM PDT, some customers experienced delays in loading threads. This was caused by a strain on our databases due to some unusually data-heavy tasks running in the background.


We stopped the tasks that caused the strain — which resolved the problem for impacted users. Thank you for your patience while we fixed this issue.</span>

On June 30, 2023 from 8:12 AM PDT to 4:23 PM PDT, some users may have had trouble signing in to Slack with magic login codes or via the &#x27;Sign In With Email&#x27; button. 


A code change inadvertently introduced a logic error in the sign-in flow. We identified the error and deployed an initial fix to correct the flawed logic. This resolved the problem with the &#x27;Sign In With Email&#x27; button. After further investigation, we deployed a second correction to address the trouble with magic login codes, resolving the issue for all affected customers.


We believed the first fix had resolved the problem for all customers, and we updated the status site accordingly. However, we discovered that the issue with magic login codes had not been addressed, and we posted a separate notice on the status site while we investigated further. We apologize for any confusion and for calling the all clear too quickly. 


We have updated the titles for both entries so that they match.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed that the issue impacting Public API and multiple services has been fully resolved. 
Users should no longer experience issues with Billing services, new User registrations, and Droplet event processing. All services related to the App platform, Managed Kubernetes, Container Registry, and Block Storage Volumes should be functioning normally.
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel. Thank you for your patience.

From 00:00 AM PDT on Saturday, June 24th, 2023 to Monday, June 26th, 2023 10:18 AM PDT, some users on the desktop and browser apps encountered a &#x27;failed to send&#x27; error message when trying to send messages with files attached. 


The issue was caused by a recent change to how file permissions are read when files are shared. This change was reverted, which resolved the problem for impacted users. 


Our team is making efforts to prevent issues like this from reoccurring in the future. Thank you for your patience while we sorted out this issue.</span>

Monitoring - The network issues affecting our AMS3 region have been mitigated. Users should no longer experience packet loss/latency, timeouts, and related issues with Droplet-based services in those regions, including Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Managed Database. 
We will continue to monitor network conditions for a period of time to establish a return to pre-incident conditions.
Jun 25, 15:18 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting the networking in our AMS3 region. During this time, a subset of users may experience intermittent packet loss or increased latency while interacting with the resources in AMS3 region.
At the moment, all the droplet-based services appear to be impacted and the users can expect to see brief connectivity issues and interrupted traffic flows. This will also be impacting services including Spaces, Managed Kubernetes and Managed Databases as well. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed that the issue impacting our Functions service has been fully resolved. If you continue to experience any issues in relation to this incident please open a ticket with our support team. Thank you for your patience.
Jun 21, 17:11 UTC
Monitoring - Functions in BLR1 region are now restored to normal service. As of 17:00 UTC, all impact has been mitigated and users should no longer experience any issues with the Functions. We are monitoring the situation and will post an update once the incident is completely resolved.
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Jun 21, 16:50 UTC
Update - Functions in FRA1 and LON1 are now restored to normal service. We continue work to remediate BLR1.
Our Engineering team has discovered that some Function invocations were duplicated, so a subset of users may have experienced that during the course of this incident.
We will post an update once the last region has returned to normal service.
Jun 21, 16:01 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has been working in order to restore the Functions service. At this time, normal service has been restored in most of the regions including AMS3, SGP1, TOR1, and SYD1.
We’re now working to fully remediate the remaining regions: BLR1, FRA1, and LON1. We will post an update as soon as that has completed. Thank you for your patience!
Jun 21, 15:43 UTC
Investigating - Beginning 14:37 UTC, our Engineering team has identified an issue impacting Functions in AMS3, BLR1, FRA1, LON1, SGP1, SYD1, and TOR1. During this time, users with standalone Functions or Functions deployed through Apps may experience performance degradation, leading to delays in Functions invocations and/or Functions working more slowly than normal.

Resolved - From 12:00 - 13:40 UTC our Engineering team observed an issue with network connectivity to US-EAST-1 and US-EAST-2 (AWS) from European datacenter regions including DigitalOcean&#x27;s AMS, FRA &amp; LON datatancers. During this time, a subset of users might have experienced high latency or errors while connecting to  services, including Droplets and Droplet-based products. We also received reports of issues in pushing/pulling images to and from DigitalOcean Container Registries. 
As of 13:40 UTC the impact has been subsided and users should no longer be facing network connectivity issues. We apologize for the inconcenience and if you are still experiencing issues or have any additional questions then please open a support ticket from within your account.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. We have restored the correct bedroom, bathroom and bed count on the Listings API.
Jun 15, 20:37 PDT
Update - We have implemented a fix to restore the correct bedrooms, bathrooms and bed values on the Listings API and will continue to monitor this incident.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we resolve this issue.
Jun 15, 14:38 PDT
Monitoring - We are currently addressing a bug that affects the bedroom, bathroom, and bed count on our Listings API. Due to a change in behavior of how bedrooms, bathrooms and beds interact with the Listing Rooms API, you might come across the following issues:
* On the Listings API, some listings might have the fields &#x60;bedrooms&#x60;,&#x60;bathrooms&#x60; and/or &#x60;beds&#x60; set to 0.
* On the Listings Rooms API, some rooms might have been created/deleted.
As of today, we have reverted the problematic behavior and are working diligently to restore the correct bedrooms, bathrooms, and beds values on the Listings API. To ensure that your Listing Rooms are accurately set, we kindly ask you to re-sync your data.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we resolve this issue.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. However, there remains a minor possibility that reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks may be sent without the guest&#x27;s last name due to an Airbnb race condition. In case you encounter this issue, please  you can retrieve the missing information with the GET Reservations API.
We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, or require further assistance.
Jun 14, 16:46 PDT
Identified - Unfortunately, the mitigation did not resolve the issue and we are still seeing reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks missing the guest last name. Please know our engineering teams are working to get this issue resolved, and we will update you with the latest information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, please use the GET reservations API for any reservations that did not include the guest last name within the webhooks. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Jun 12, 08:41 PDT
Monitoring - We have implemented a fix for this issue and are monitoring the results. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
Jun  9, 00:12 PDT
Identified - The issue has been identified and we are working on a fix.
Meanwhile, please attempt GET reservations requests for any reservations that did not include the guest names in full within the webhooks.
Jun  8, 19:36 PDT
Investigating - We are currently investigating an issue where guest names are not returned in full within webhooks - namely the reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks. This is not a widespread issue and is only affecting a small percentage of webhooks.
Alternatively, you may be able to retrieve the details with GET reservations requests.
We will post updates as soon as we know more.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.</span>
