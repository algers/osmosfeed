Resolved - Beginning around 16:48 UTC, our Engineering team identified an issue impacting a subset of Droplets in our BLR1 region. From 16:48 UTC to 17:45 UTC, impacted Droplets did not have correctly functioning networking capabilities. Additionally, users were unable to perform any events (such as power off, recycle, resize, etc) and any changes to the Cloud Firewalls for impacted Droplets were not being applied.
Our Engineering team has resolved the issue and networking and the Cloud Firewalls on all Droplets should be functioning normally.  
We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.</span>

From 9:30 AM PST on November 28, 2023 to 12:30 AM PST on November 29, 2023, some users in Asia were experiencing issues with Slack loading. Most of the impacted users were in Japan and India.


We traced this back to an unexpected spike in a database load for which we quickly saw recovery.


We monitored the situation closely and as the load reduced without intervention, we did not take any mitigating actions.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
Nov 28, 19:36 UTC
Update - We were not able to publish webhooks in response to push events triggered between 16:23 and 17:12 UTC. To avoid further disruption to customer workflows, we’ve decided not to continue our attempts to re-process those events. 
Workflows that trigger on pull_request or git push events may not have been run during this time period. 
You can run impacted workflows manually or by pushing a new commit to the same branch.
Nov 28, 18:09 UTC
Update - Customers saw push event deliveries for Actions and Webhooks fail between 16:23 and 17:12 (UTC). We fixed the issue, and we are working to re-process push events for the affected time period.

Resolved - This incident has been resolved. An interaction between two feature flag rollouts caused us to suppress delivery of push webhooks between 16:23 and 17:11 UTC in a manner that evaded our existing observability. This affected 71,000 repositories whose users will have noted missing webhook deliveries and/or experienced Actions jobs with push triggers failing to start. During this period, around 25% of new Actions jobs were impacted. The issues were resolved by disabling one of the feature flags in question.
After weighing various options for retroactively dispatching old push webhooks, we concluded that the risk of delivering stale data to customers with these redeliveries outweighed the possible benefit.
As follow up to this incident, we are working to improve monitoring of webhook throughput and to document a policy around webhook redelivery timelines.
Nov 28, 17:59 UTC
Update - Actions is operating normally.

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
On November 27, 2023 at 18:46 UTC, we attempted to rotate our OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow certificates. Due to an error in the certificate formatting, we uploaded an invalid certificate configuration that was not observed in our pre-production testing. Our background job servers were unable to start because a valid configuration is required at worker start up. As a result, users experienced delays in Pull Requests, Webhooks, Issues, Actions and Projects. Rollback of the change was slowed by the invalid certificate as our deployment system relied on the same certificate. Rollback was completed at 20:35 UTC. Most services recovered by 20:44 UTC. 

Delayed updates to Issues and Pull Requests were applied normally once…</span>

Resolved - On November 21, 2023, at 09:50 UTC GitHub Actions jobs encountered delays due to an incident in our background job service caused by excessive rebalancing in a Kafka consumer group. After a quick mitigation, we began to see recovery on the job queues by 10:02 UTC. During this time window 100% of Actions jobs were delayed in starting for up to 11 minutes.
Unfortunately, the rapid queue recovery sent a thundering herd of jobs to Actions hosted runner pools, causing a database deadlock that resulted in some hosted runner pools having increased latency when accepting new jobs. This affected only a small percentage of overall jobs, around 2%. Configuration changes led to a resolution and the system was fully recovered by 11:27 UTC and all in progress jobs were processed.
The incident is now resolved.
Nov 21, 11:12 UTC
Update - We&#x27;ve applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.
Nov 21, 10:24 UTC
Update - We have recovery for the underlying issue but are waiting for Actions queues to catch up. We expect this to be completed in less than 1 hour(s).
Nov 21, 10:11 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:

On November 8, 2023 from 7:55 AM PT until 8:27 PM PT, a small number of users experienced errors when attempting to join or start huddles.


We traced this back to an unexpected spike in a database load for which we quickly saw recovery.


We monitored the situation closely and in an effort to prevent further unexpected error spikes, we implemented a strategic configuration adjustment to optimize the load on our database.


Affected users should no longer experience issues with huddles.</span>

Resolved - Due to a configuration error, some scenarios in the eu1.make.com, eu2.make.com and us1.make.com zones may have intermittently failed to execute and in case of multiple consecutive errors get disabled by the system. According to our telemetry, the number of impacted scenarios was very small. Customers may have experienced this behavior between 9:45am and 8:00pm CET. We have addressed the configuration problem and all executions are now stable. We will continue monitoring the situation.</span>

Resolved - On Nov 16 and 17, some inquiries and pre-approvals expired prematurely, causing guests to be unable to accept them because Airbnb incorrectly showed these listings as unavailable, even though they were actually available. Additionally, Hosts were experiencing difficulties in creating new pre-approvals during this period. We apologize for the inconvenience that this issue has caused.
This issue started on Nov 16 around 12:00 AM PST and was resolved on Nov 17 at 9:10 AM PST, and we expect this to be fully resolved. Please contact us if you are still seeing this issue.</span>

Resolved - On 2023-11-15, from 09:44 to 10:42 UTC, some GitHub customers experienced increased latency or errors accessing repo data.
High concurrent access to a specific git object exposed a bug that forced a backend service to perform excessive calculations, overloading the service. Access to this repo was paused while load was re-rerouted, mitigating the problem.
The conditions that triggered the expensive operations have been identified and refactored.
Nov 15, 11:33 UTC
Update - Error rates and performance have returned to normal.
Nov 15, 11:21 UTC
Update - We have identified the source of the issue and have removed the additional load from the service. Sporadic delays in pull request experiences and intermittent 500s are still occurring and impacting a very small percentage of traffic. Next update is expected within 30 minutes.
Nov 15, 11:04 UTC
Update - We are seeing connectivity issues between some of our systems and git backend services. This is causing intermittent error responses and delays in pull request experiences for a very small percentage of traffic. We are investigating mitigations and expect to provide another update within 30 minutes.
Nov 15, 09:50 UTC
Investigating - We are currently investigating this issue.</span>

From 3:15 PM PST on November 14, 2023 to around 4:13 PM PST, a small number of customers using the Slack desktop app were unable to connect to Slack. This may have manifested as a &quot;Something&#x27;s gone awry&quot; error page.


A recent code change inadvertently introduced a logic error that prevented the desktop app from connecting as expected. We reverted this code change as an immediate mitigation step, then rolled out a fix to correct the logic error. 


The fix resolved the issue for all affected customers, restoring full access to Slack.</span>

                              <span>Issue Summary:


From 4:00 PM PDT on October 31, 2023 to 2:00 PM PDT on November 9, 2023, user presence would unexpectedly change to away or inactive.


We determined that an error during a routine system optimization on connectivity state caused this issue. 


We reverted the change which fixed the issue for all affected customers.


Thank you for your patience while we resolved this.</span>

From 10:00 PM PST on November 7, 2023 to 1:15 PM PST on November 8, 2023, some users experienced issues with their user status not updating, removing previews, and being unable to mark channels as read. Some keyboard shortcuts were also affected and were unable to be used.


We determined that a recent code change was the root cause for the unexpected behaviour with these features.


To restore functionality, we reverted the related code. We then did some additional testing and monitoring to confirm all issues were fully resolved and Slack was operating as expected.</span>

Resolved - Our internal search infrastructure experienced increased latency and timeouts between 13:15 and 14:05 UTC leading to some end user timeouts and slow responses for any requests that made use of that subsystem. This included but was not limited to: user search, repository search, releases, and audit logs.
We mitigated the issue by migrating traffic to an older version of our search clusters and are investigating what caused the performance issues in our new clusters.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the full resolution of issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO regions. 
Users should no longer experience any latency or timeout issue with any of the Droplet based services. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Nov  3, 20:58 UTC
Monitoring - As of 19:55 UTC, our Engineering team has confirmed that a fix has been implemented by our upstream carrier to mitigate the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. 
We are closely monitoring the situation and will update as soon as we have more information from the provider.
Nov  3, 19:43 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. Upstream congestion with a network provider between Los Angeles and Dallas is impacting traffic traversing out of our SFO datacentres.
A case has been opened by our team with the provider. Our team has attempted to shift traffic to improve the situation, but unfortunately, we continue to see approximately 10% of customer traffic impacted by this issue.
Our team is working on an option to shift to an alternate provider if this issue is not able to be resolved by the provider in a timely manner. We will share another update once we have further information from the provider or we have an update from our Engineering team.
Nov  3, 19:27 UTC
Investigating - As of 17:40 UTC, our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting networking in the SFO regions. During this time, a subset of users may experience packet loss/latency and timeouts with Droplet based services in these regions, including Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Managed Database. We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacte…</span>
