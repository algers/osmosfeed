                              <span>Description: Microsoft Defender is flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware.
These classifications are false positives, and we are working with Microsoft to
resolve the situation.
As of 2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC, we have confirmed that Microsoft have addressed
the false positive, meaning Defender no longer flags Tailscale 1.46.1 as
malware. A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.
What happened?
Microsoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware. This caused
Defender to quarantine the binaries, meaning they could not run.
We submitted Tailscale 1.46.1 to Microsoft to investigate the false positive,
who then updated Defender to avoid flagging this release as malware at
2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC.
Who is affected?
People using Defender and Tailscale 1.46.1.
What is the impact?
Tailscale will not run on affected machines.
What do I need to do?
To resolve this issue on your own tailnet, you can take either or both of 2
approaches:
Update to a newer version of Tailscale. Newer versions are not affected by this problem.
Create an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.
Update Microsoft Defender.</span>

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
From 11:21 to 16:07 UTC some GitHub customers experienced errors cloning via workflows or via the command line.
A third-party configuration change resulted in an unexpected behavior to our systems that resulted in Git clone failures. Once we detected the change we were able to disable it, and our systems started operating normally.
With the incident mitigated, we are working with our third-party provider to improve subsequent configuration change rollouts.
Oct 22, 15:58 UTC
Update - We have mitigated the cause of the issue and are awaiting positive confirmation from impacted customers that the issue is fully resolved.
Oct 22, 15:34 UTC
Update - We are currently investigating reports from some customers encountering errors when cloning repositories via workflows or via the command line. We do not currently have an ETA for resolution. Next update in 30 minutes.
Oct 22, 15:16 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Git Operations</span>

Resolved - From 10:59 UTC to 13:48 UTC, GitHub Codespaces service was down or degraded due to an outage in our authentication service.This issue impacted 67% of users over this time period.
Our service auth layer experienced throttling with our third party dependencies due to higher load. This impacted all user facing scenarios for Codespaces service. Our automated regional failover kicked in, but it failed to mitigate as this issue impacted the service globally. We mitigated manually by reducing load on external dependency.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess and implement scaling improvements to make our service more resilient with increasing load.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the resolution of the issue that impacted the Spaces CDN. Objects should be accessible over the CDN endpoint without any issues. However, HTTP/2 is temporarily unavailable due to upstream issues, and due to this HTTP/2 requests should automatically be re-negotiated to 1.1, but in case you experience failures please open a ticket with our support team.
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.

Update - After our upstream provider implemented a remediation step to resolve the issue with the Spaces CDN, the Spaces CDN is serving the objects stored in the Spaces bucket without any errors or performance issues. However, we are still monitoring the situation closely and we&#x27;ll share more in…</span>

Resolved - On October 9, 2023 at 14:24 UTC, a noticeable delay in commits appearing in pull requests was detected.  During the incident, approximately 9% of pull requests (less than the 20% first reported) experienced staleness of up to 7m. The root cause was identified to be an increase in the latency of a downstream dependency causing pull request workers to saturate their available capacity, resulting in delayed updates to PRs - no data was lost during this incident.
	We mitigated this by adding additional capacity to the affected worker pool at 15:02 UTC. This allowed our background jobs to catch up with the backlog of updates and provide relief to our customers. Additionally, we have significantly increased the performance of the downstream service to prevent recurrence
Oct  9, 14:52 UTC
Update - We are investigating delays for commits showing up on Pull Requests page loads in the web UI. As a result of this,  about 20% of pull requests are currently showing stale data of up-to 7m. We are currently investigating contributing factors right now.

On Friday, October 6 2023, from 1:52 AM PDT to 2:12 AM PDT, some users were unable to load Slack. This was caused by an issue where certain backend Slack processes were pulling data from our database rather than their cache which caused strain on our servers.


We rolled out a change to how these processes load data, and the issue was resolved for all users.</span>

Resolved - We deployed a new configuration to improve our network availability. This resulted in a small percentage of user traffic getting incorrectly blocked, but missed by our automated detections. We mitigated this with a change to the configuration, rolled out slowly over the last hour of this incident time for safe deployment. Beyond the learnings related to the config, we are analyzing how we can more quickly detect this kind of impact as part of future configuration rollouts.
Oct  6, 02:42 UTC
Update - We have confirmed that the fix has resolved the issue in the subset of regions where it has been deployed. We are now continuing the deployment to the remaining regions.
Oct  6, 02:03 UTC
Update - We are monitoring the rollout of the fix and are beginning to see signs of improvement. We will send another update shortly.
Oct  6, 01:31 UTC
Update - A small number of customers are experiencing 403 errors when attempting to access repository data via the API. We have found what we believe to be the cause of the issue and are deploying a fix.
Oct  6, 01:12 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for API Requests</span>

Resolved - On October 5, 2023 at 13:40 UTC, our monitoring systems observed an increase in the time it was taking for Git pushes to become visible when viewing commits in Pull Requests. Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.

                              <span>Issue Summary:


On Oct 4, 2023 from 11:15 PM PDT to around 11:58 PM PDT a small subset of users experienced trouble connecting to Slack and sending and receiving messages.


A code change optimizing resource usage caused a core service to restart causing brief connectivity issues for a few users.


The service recovered automatically and we’ve put measures in place to prevent this from happening in the future.</span>

On October 3, 2023 from 4:00 PM PDT to 4:20 PM PDT, some customers had trouble loading threads, mentions, reactions and search results in Slack.


We determined that this was caused during the process of changing our database hosts on our backend. To mitigate the issue, we stopped the change which fixed the issue for affected customers.


We&#x27;re sorry for any disruption this may have caused and thank you for your patience while we looked into this</span>

On October 2, 2023 from 12:18PM PDT to 12:26PM PDT, some users noticed that threads were not loading correctly.


We identified a database issue on our backend that was causing the threads to not load. The issue was mitigated and users should no longer experience trouble loading threads.


We are investigating the cause of the database issue so we can ensure this does not happen again.


We apologize for any interruption to your work day!</span>

Resolved - From 14:44 UTC to 18:04 UTC we experienced another issue with our App Platform service related to CDN Insights for Apps in all regions. During this window, users might have observed blank graphs or no data for the CDN metrics including request counts, cache hit rates etc. Our engineering team was able to identify the problem and resolve it fully and as of 18:04 UTC all the metrics are displaying properly. 
The connectivity issue with the Apps for which we updated the status page earlier was only faced by a subset of users in FRA1 region, only between 12:45 UTC to 14:15 UTC. The normal functionality of apps was entirely restored around 14:15 UTC.
Thank you for your patience on this and if you continue to face issues then please open a support ticket from within the cloud control panel.</span>
