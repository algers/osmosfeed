On June 13, 2023 from 11:55 AM PDT to around 3:47 PM PDT, some users may have experienced failure with clips transcribing and transcoding, execution of workflows with custom functions, new deployments of apps with hosted functions, and some delay when using canvases in Slack. 


These issues were due to an outage from an upstream service provider which affected many services. The provider actively worked to remediate those issues, which then fully resolved the reported failures for impacted Slack users.</span>

Identified - Unfortunately, the mitigation did not resolve the issue and we are still seeing reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks missing the guest last name. Please know our engineering teams are working to get this issue resolved, and we will update you with the latest information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, please use the GET reservations API for any reservations that did not include the guest last name within the webhooks. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Jun 12, 08:41 PDT
Monitoring - We have implemented a fix for this issue and are monitoring the results. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
Jun  9, 00:12 PDT
Identified - The issue has been identified and we are working on a fix.
Meanwhile, please attempt GET reservations requests for any reservations that did not include the guest names in full within the webhooks.
Jun  8, 19:36 PDT
Investigating - We are currently investigating an issue where guest names are not returned in full within webhooks - namely the reservation acceptance confirmation webhooks. This is not a widespread issue and is only affecting a small percentage of webhooks.
Alternatively, you may be able to retrieve the details with GET reservations requests.
We will post updates as soon as we know more.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.</span>

Mini Incident Report
We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Workspace Support using the help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.
(All Times US/Pacific)
Incident Start: 08 June 2023 at 14:00
Incident End: 13 June 2023 at 07:50
Duration:  4 days, 17 hours, 50 minutes
Affected Services and Features:
Google Sheets - GOOGLEFINANCE function
Regions/Zones: Global
Description:
Google Sheets users experienced issues with fetching finance data using the built-in GOOGLEFINANCE function. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a change to a backend component. The change caused the GOOGLEFINANCE requests to return N/A value. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the change.
Customer Impact:
Affected users would have experienced data returned by the GOOGLEFINANCE function alternating between correct value and #NA.

Affected products: Google Sheets</span>

In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jun 12, 11:00 PDT
Scheduled - The deprecation date for API Webhook Version 2021.12.31 was May 31, 2023. Any applications that have not fully migrated webhooks will be automatically migrated to a newer version, which can result in application breakage.
Automatic webhook migration will occur in phases as detailed in https://developer.airbnb.com/docs/versioning-enforcement
Phase 1 will occur during the week of June 12th, 2023 and will automatically migrate all async webhooks (except Messaging, Reviews and Reservations).</span>

On June 02, 2023 from 3:28 PM PDT to around 5:29 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced large empty spaces in the Workflow Builder UI and issues with publishing/adding or editing steps in a workflow. 


We traced the issue to a recent code change which caused the channel selector to appear out of view, resulting in the inability to take certain actions while editing a workflow. 


We reverted the change which solved the issue for all customers.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jun  1, 01:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 31, 23:11 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-06-01 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-06-01 05:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO2 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

From May 30th, 2023 at 8:02 AM PDT until 11:18 AM PDT, some users experienced unexpected behavior with autocomplete suggestions, including incorrect rankings &amp; incomplete results when conducting searches.


We traced the source of the issue back to an error that occurred in our autocomplete cache. A fix was rolled out to our search logic which began to show the correct results.


Users can refresh their Slack client (by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R) if they are still experiencing issues. We apologize for any interruption.</span>

From May 30th, 2023 at around 8:00 PM PDT until May 31st, 2023 at 9:20 AM PDT, users with the Reacji Channeler app installed in their workspace experienced some issues where the app would not execute.


The issue was traced back to a recent change that occurred for one of our app databases. This caused the app to accept new requests even though it was unable to connect to the database, resulting in timeout errors. 


We reverted the change and restarted the backend processes which allowed the app to connect to the database again, resolving the issue for impacted users. We apologize for any disruptions to your day.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the full resolution of the issue impacting Spaces performance and availability in our NYC3 region.
From 00:20 to 00:57 UTC, users may have experienced slowness or timeouts when trying to access or manage their Spaces resources in NYC3, static site assets in NYC, or App Platform bandwidth insights.
Spaces should now be operating normally. If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel. We apologize for any inconvenience.
May 31, 01:47 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has observed recovery of availability for Spaces in our NYC3 region. 
Availability returned to 100% at 00:57 UTC and since then, users should not be experiencing any issues with Spaces or App Platform. 
We&#x27;ll now monitor the situation for a period of time and post a final update once we confirm the incident is resolved.
May 31, 01:05 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating a drop in availability for Spaces in our NYC region. During this time, some users may experience errors with API or object requests, be unable to create new buckets in NYC3, and/or see issues with loading Spaces in the Cloud Control Panel. 
Additionally, users of App Platform will be unable to see bandwidth insights in their dashboards and static site users may notice errors fetching assets from Spaces buckets in NYC3. 
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has continued to actively monitor the situation resulting from multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. Over the last few days, our team has continued to make routing changes where possible. 
Crews have been able to complete some cable repairs and we expect to see our network routing stabilize once the repair of a few more cables are completed in the coming weeks. Until then, we expect to see intermittent periods of packet loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and New York City, as well as Singapore and Toronto. These are normally short-lived and happen during Singapore business hours when traffic is heavy. 
Given the relative stability of routes, we will now close out this incident and provide any needed updates sepa…</span>

                              <span>On May 23, 2023 between 8:38 AM PDT and 9:44 AM PDT some users were unable to send and edit messages, load threads, join channels and create group DMs.


Our investigation uncovered that a recent code change we made had caused an overwhelming impact on our databases. We rolled this change back and temporarily redirected user traffic as our databases recovered. Once we rolled back the change and our databases were in a healthier state, the issue became resolved for impacted users.


We will continue to implement new ways to detect issues like this early-on.


Thank you for your patience while we investigated and resolved the issue.</span>

                              <span>Issue summary:

On May 23, 2023 from 5:30 PM PDT to around 8:15 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced blank profile pictures, display names, channel names, and emoji in Slack.


A code change inadvertently altered the firewall rules for some of our regional servers, preventing the Slack clients connected to these regions from loading profile and channel elements as expected.


As an immediate mitigation step, we stopped the code change from rolling out any further, and pushed all traffic from the affected servers to other regions. This resolved the issue for impacted customers. 


We then reverted the code change and manually restored the correct firewall rules on the affected servers. Once the correct rules were back in place, we reintroduced traffic to these regions, fully resolving the issue.</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 24, 16:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 24, 15:05 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-24 16:00 UTC
End:  2023-05-24 20:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. This will be the final phase of the three maintenance activities performed by our team in AMS3 on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 23, 16:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 23, 15:20 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-23 16:00 UTC
End: 2023-05-23 20:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the AMS3 region. This will be the second of three maintenance activities performed by our team in AMS3 on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Resolved - We have identified and fixed an issue related to missing PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE standard fee that occurred between 07:41 AM PDT May 17th until 10:17 AM PDT May 23rd 2023. 
The issue caused standard fee PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE to be cleared and as a result some reservations might be missing the cleaning fee. 
Please reapply the Standard Fees by making PUT pricing_settings requests with the desired fees.
This should re-populate the listings&#x27; Standard Fees array as intended, namely the PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE.
If you have any further queries related to this incident, please submit a ticket via the Partner Support Portal and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
Apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From 12:24 - 13:26 UTC, we experienced an issue that impacted our DNS API services. During this time, customer deployments to App Platform will have failed to process, and managing domains and DNS records through both the Cloud Control Panel and API would have been unavailable. 
If you continue to experience problems with either of these services please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel. Thank you for your patience.
May 20, 13:57 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team identified that the root cause of the issues impacting App Platform deployments was a wider issue involving our DNS API. Along with the App Platform deployment errors, customers would have experienced trouble viewing and editing domains and their DNS records through both the Cloud Control Panel and the API. 
A fix has been rolled out and as of 13:26 UTC customers should no longer be experiencing any issues involving the services listed above. Our team will continue to monitor the situation to ensure stability and provide a final update as soon as we confirm the issue has been fully resolved. 
Thank you for your patience.
May 20, 12:46 UTC
Investigating - As of 12:24 UTC, Our Engineering team is investigating a global issue with our App Platform service. During this time, users may experience issues while performing any operations for new, updated and deleting deployments. 
At this time, previously deployed running Apps are not impacted. We will provide an update as soon as possible.</span>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
From 17:06 - 17:39 UTC, we experienced an availability outage on an internal storage cluster, due to an issue with a networking component. Users may have seen degraded performance with Volumes, issues connecting to Managed Kubernetes clusters, issues creating/deleting Mongo clusters, and delayed deploys/updates to existing Apps in our FRA1 region. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel. Thank you for your patience throughout this incident.

During this redirection we saw a higher than anticipated volume of failed API requests which resulted in an impact to the Slack service. As a result, Slack was down between 1:56 PM PDT - 2:03 PM PDT.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
May 16, 22:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 16, 21:06 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-05-16 22:00 UTC
End: 2023-05-17 02:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the NYC2 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket .</span>

Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer network traffic due to this maintenance. 
Should an unexpected issue arise, a possible outcome would be a failure of control plane events, including, but not limited to, Droplet and Droplet-based service creates, Snapshots, Backups, etc. Should this failure occur, we will update this post with further details.
