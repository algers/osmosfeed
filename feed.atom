Severity: Critical
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon tailscaled, which can then be used to remotely execute code.
Affected platforms: Windows
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.
Who is affected?
All Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.
Reviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.

Severity: Low
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access Tailscale environment variables.
Affected platforms: All
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.
Who is affected?
All Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.
An attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.
There is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.
