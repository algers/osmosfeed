Update - Our Engineering team has confirmed that additional network routes are impacted, alongside the impact previously mentioned for our SFO datacenters.
Notably, routes between NYC and SGP were heavily impacted for a period of time, before we were able to shift traffic and improve performance. 
Additionally, routes between SYD and NYC were seeing extreme latency. After shifting of traffic, performance has improved but continues to show higher-than-normal latency. 
Due to there being a major issue with East to West North American traffic with at least two major upstream providers, DigitalOcean traffic on any routes following East to West North American traffic may be impacted. Our Engineering team is making traffic shifts as quickly as possible, where possible. 
We continue to await more information from the upstream providers.
Sep 13, 20:45 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has confirmed upstream issues with two providers, leading to poor network performance in our SFO datacenters. Our team is engaging with those providers as well as exploring any possible routing configurations to improve performance. 
At this time, users will see packet loss, latency, and possible connection errors for Droplets, Droplet-based services like Managed Kubernetes, and App Platform Apps. 
We'll provide another update when we have further information or if our team is able to improve the situation via routing configurations.
Sep 13, 20:23 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with networking in our SFO datacenters. At this time, there appears to be an upstream issue with a provider impacting networking performance on routes to and from SFO for DigitalOcean services, including Droplets and Droplet-based services like Managed Kubernetes and App Platform Apps. 
We will post a further update as soon as we have more information.]]></summary>

From September 6, 2023 at 9:50 PM PDT until September 7, 2023 at 3:18 AM PDT, some users may have encountered a 500 error when attempting to access their app configuration pages. 


We determined that a code change inadvertently omitted some recently updated parameters, causing these pages to return errors and preventing customers from accessing or modifying their app configurations.


We implemented an initial fix to rectify the 500 errors for most pages, and then a second fix to address any outstanding issues. With both fixes in place, we restored full access to all app configuration pages.]]></summary>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On Friday, 25 August 2023, some ChromeOS device users experienced failures which prevented user sign in. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>The root cause is due to a combination of unexpected increased traffic and an inefficient code in the policy fetch that created excessive objects. The device management server was unable to handle requests from client devices as the compute usage spiked above its limit. This ultimately impacted all requests, as the device management server was triggered to auto reject requests.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were internally alerted to the ChromeOS outage on 25 August at 08:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers quickly identified an increase in usage on the device management servers and took steps to remove the blockage that was causing requests to be rejected, this mitigated the issue and allowed traffic to return to normal and for successful requests to process on 25 August  at 11:40 US/Pacific.</p>
<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the current capacity limit alerting to detect excessive usage quicker</li>
</ul>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode.

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…]]></summary>

From 11:32 PM PDT on August 29, 2023 to 02:06 AM PDT on August 30, 2023, some users may have seen an internal server or connection error in workflow and app modals.


We determined that a code change inadvertently caused an issue where incorrect data was stored in our database. When a modal was opened it used this incorrect data and displayed a connection error to users.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

On August 28, 2023 from 4:30 AM PDT to 10:30 AM PDT, less than 1% of Slack users encountered slowness when loading channels, DMs, and threads. Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.


We found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. 


We restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. 


We're continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.]]></summary>

of the UPnP implementations in some routers, could expose all UDP ports of a

As of 2023-08-22 2:30 AM UTC, we have changed the Tailscale coordination server

degrade NAT traversal and may cause some connections to route through DERP.
This may increase node-to-node latency and decrease throughput. Version 1.48.1
resolves the issue and re-enables port mapping via UPnP.
What happened?
Tailscale nodes use UPnP as one of the mechanisms to open UDP port forwarding
in routers to help with NAT traversal. Tailscale picks a node port and an

On August 17, 2023 from 9:20 AM PDT to 9:37 AM PDT, some users encountered issues with messages not sending and channels and threads failing to load.


We determined that a recent indexing change caused a higher than expected level of requests to our database. The resulting high load errors were responsible for the impacted users' inability to load messages and channels.


We immediately reverted this change, which resolved the issue for affected users. We then deployed a fix to prevent this from reoccurring in the future.]]></summary>

Update - Our Engineering team continues work on the rollout with the fix for Python builds failing in App Platform. 
We've identified that a very small number of Apps are impacted by this issue - less than 1% of users have encountered this issue. 
We will post an update once the rollout completes.
Aug 15, 20:27 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has investigated and identified an issue impacting Python builds for App Platform. Beginning approximately 17:30 UTC, users will see the error "Requested runtime 'python-3.11.3' is not available for this stack (heroku-18)". 
The team is in the process of rolling out a fix. 
In the meantime as a workaround, users may update their Apps to use the Ubuntu 22.04-based stack. This stack is in beta, but provides dependency upgrades, and removes support for PHP version 8.0 and earlier. To update, users will need to specify the new stack in the app spec by adding: 
"features:
    - buildpack-stack=ubuntu-22"
We will post another update once the fix has completed rolling out.]]></summary>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug 15, 18:02 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug 15, 17:06 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-15 18:00 UTC
End: 2023-08-15 22:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the FRA1 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.]]></summary>
