        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:


Starting September 6th, 2022, we identified an issue with the Google Sheet app inside Workflow Builder. This issue caused the app to read the spreadsheet date/time format wrong, inserting the incorrect time value in the timestamp.


We discovered this was due to the app processing the workflow step with a single digit value instead of a double digit value.


Users can continue highlighting the Submission Time column in the spreadsheet and select Format → Number → Custom Number Format and insert: ddd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss, as a workaround.


We will work to fix this through a bug ticket that has been filed as a result of this incident. Though we have not resolved this issue yet, we will provide further updates through customer support tickets with the impacted users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
Today, we are glad to announce yet a new feature: a brand new Dashboard section that will allow you to easily manage your daily tasks, directly from your Smily account.
Here is a sneak peek at what the new Dashboard looks like:

In the past, managing day to day operations may have been complicated. Tasks such as keeping track of payments, approving pending tentatives and others were time consuming.
Thanks to the Dashboard, you now have access to the following information:
List of pending tentatives: to help you convert them into confirmed bookings, or cancel them to free up the dates in your calendar
List of bookings with missing payments: to help you get all your payments on time and never miss a payment again
List of arrivals of the day: to help you plan the check-in of your guests
List of departures of the day: to help you plan the check-out of your guests
You can find more details in the dedicated manual article, and a video guided tour of the new Dashboard section will soon be added there as well.
We invite you to explore this new Dashboard, and hope it will help you save time and better manage your daily operations. Some improvements will also be made in the future, such as adding performance metrics to help you manage your business more easily.]]></summary>

When you view a channel, Slack remembers your last scroll position so we can take you back to the same place. A recent feature update inadvertently bypassed the check for this scroll position, creating the impression that Slack wasn't respecting your Mark as Read preference. Additionally, this incorrectly prevented channel history from loading for some users.

On August 25, 2022 between 11:31 AM PDT and 12:37 PM PDT, some customers experienced trouble loading the Workflow Builder screen.


We traced the problem to a change in the front-end Workflow Builder components which prevented the Workflow Builder from starting up successfully. We reverted this, resolving the issue for all affected customers.]]></summary>

From August 22, 2022 5:15 PM PDT to August 23, 2022 01:15 AM PDT, some customers experienced a persistent reload prompt when when their user account was converted from a member account to a guest account, even after a reload was completed.


A recent change made to our code resulted in the removal of a mechanism for indicating when a reload dialogue should appear. We have pushed a fix for this problem by reinstating the mechanism to ensure this only occurs for users once.]]></summary>

On August 23, 2022 between 12:17 PM PDT and 1:32 PM PDT, some customers experienced difficulty with loading Slack and sending messages. This occurred when a group of database servers became overloaded and failed.


We first reduced the load on our infrastructure manually. The issue was then resolved when our automated processes kicked in, replacing the damaged server with a healthy one. While the issue is resolved, we will continue to investigate the root cause to avoid these problems in the future.]]></summary>
