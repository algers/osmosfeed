Resolved - We have identified an issue with creating room amenity photos. The issue would cause POST requests to fail with either a 404 error or a 500 error. This issue approximately started from last Friday, October 14th, 2022. The photo creations are successful in most cases but the requests fail at a later stage resulting in error responses.
We have fixed this issue at 3:30pm PT today, but there can be duplicate photos created for room amenities during this time. We advise you to review room amenity photos and use the DELETE endpoint to remove duplicate photos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:

On October 13, 2022 from 3:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT, a number of customers had trouble loading and receiving thread notifications. Some customers may have also had trouble with loading channels, adding users to group direct messages, API hyperlink rendering, and missing Saved items.


A mass de-provisioning event inadvertently increased load across our infrastructure, causing issues with Threads for many users. 


As an immediate mitigation strategy, we temporarily deactivated the Threads view for all users. 


In parallel, we ended the long running de-provisioning jobs, and significantly scaled up the systems that handle those jobs. We also made several code changes to reduce the effect a de-provisioning job of this scale would have on our infrastructure, and redistributed some of the load across other parts of the system. 


The optimisation and redistribution work brought error rates down, which resolved most of the issues with channel loading, group direct messages, hyperlinks, and Saved items that users were experiencing. 


At this point, we made the call not to re-enable the Threads view in order to give our recovery efforts more time to restore balance to the system. 


Once the load was appropriately balanced across our infrastructure, and we were able to confirm that our up-scaling systems were prepared to handle any future spikes, we re-enabled the Threads view for all users.]]></summary>
