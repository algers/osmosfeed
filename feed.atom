On February 29, 2024 from 1:28 PM PST to around 4:36 PM PST, users were unable to create or update some workflows.

We determined that a recent code change had inadvertently introduced a logic problem, resulting in errors for workflows that used event triggers. We reverted this code change. However, rolling back reintroduced a separate issue that we'd resolved earlier in the day. 

We prepared a tailored revert to roll back the code causing the workflow problem while also including the fix for the previous issue. This second revert resolved both problems, restoring full functionality to Slack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Incident began at <strong>2024-02-26 09:42</strong> and ended at <strong>2024-02-26 21:02</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class="cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text"><h1>Incident Report</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On Monday, 26 February 2024 at 1:42 US/Pacific, Google Apps Script experienced a higher rate of failures while attempting various operational actions for a duration of 11 hours, 20 minutes. Apps Script integrations in Google Workspace products, such as those that integrate with Google Calendar and Google Docs, were partially unavailable. This includes 3rd party Google Workspace add-ons that were built using Apps Script. During the incident, the issue was intermittent for most users with overall error rates of up to 25% for the listed services, and customers retrying actions were eventually successful.</p>
<p>This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>A third-party Google Workspace Add-on with a large pre-existing install base added a dependency on Google Apps Script, which triggered a significant increase in load for the Apps Script service. Due to this high QPS, latencies increased, followed by an increase in error rates. All server threads supporting Apps Script integrations were busy processing requests, causing our servers to start rejecting requests and resulting in errors. Ultimately this resulted in temporary service interruption for users who rely on Apps Script functionality within their Google Workspace environments.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineering was alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on Monday 26 February 2024 at 00:16 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineering identified the problematic deployment, rolled back the change, and temporarily blocked access to the add-on so the service could fulfill requests as expected. This resulted in a significant error rate decrease, services became available, and the issue was fully recovered on Monday 26 February, 2024 13:02 US/Pacific.</p>
<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding additional system limits to prevent a single Apps Script project from creating overload scenarios</li>
<li>Improving the process for blocking problematic Apps Script projects</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>
<p>On Monday, 26 February 2024 from 01:42 to 13:02 US/Pacific customers utilizing products with Apps Script integrations may have experienced the following:</p>
<h3>Apps Script</h3>
<p>Apps Script encountered errors during the creation or loading of scripts.</p>
<h3>Google Calendar</h3>
<p>A subset of customers encountered failures while listing the third-party conferencing solutions. Additionally, failures were observed while attaching a conference to an event with the Google Calendar.</p>
<h3>Google Forms, Google sheets and Google docs</h3>
<p>Custom functions and Add-ons created with Apps Script would have experienced disruptions when used in Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms.</p>

Resolved - On February 29, 2024, between 9:32 and 11:54 UTC, queuing in our background job service caused processing delays to Webhooks, Actions, and Issues. Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.
We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:
On February 26, 2024 from 9:00 AM PST to 9:36 AM PST, some users experienced problems sending and loading messages in Slack. Others may have completed these actions successfully but more slowly than expected.

Earlier today, we deployed a routine update to part of our network infrastructure. During this work, we deprovisioned some of our proxy servers and provisioned a new set. Some of our webapp servers took longer than expected to sync with the new list of proxy servers, resulting in a spike in connection errors. This coincided with the regular 9:00 AM PST increase in traffic to our servers, which may have exacerbated impact.

By around 9:36 AM PST, error rates had decreased and user impact had completely subsided, most likely due to our automatic scaling functionality. However, we're continuing to analyze data from this event to fully understand the root cause and prevent similar issues in the future.]]></summary>

Resolved - On Monday, February 26th, from 20:45 UTC to 21:39 UTC, GitHub Packages reported an outage indicating a degradation in GitHub Container Registry and NPM package upload functionality. Upon investigation, we found a misconfigured observability metric which inadvertently pulled in data from a newly provisioned test environment. All failures being reported were traced back to this test environment. We confirmed that there was no real customer impact to GitHub Packages during this incident. We have since reconfigured our observability metrics to accurately report based on environment.
Feb 26, 21:20 UTC
Update - We are seeing some recovery in NPM and GitHub Container Registry functionality, but are maintaining red status until we are certain issues won’t recur.
Feb 26, 21:03 UTC

Resolved - On February 26, 2024, between 18:34 UTC and 19:37 UTC our background job service was degraded and caused job start delays up to 15 minutes. Users experienced delays in Webhooks, Actions, and some UI updates (e.g. a delay in UI updates on pull requests). This was due to capacity problems with our job queueing service, and a failure of our automated failover system.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over to our secondary cluster.   No data was lost - recovery began at 18:55 UTC, when the backlog of enqueued jobs began to process.
We are actively working to repair our failover automation and expand the capacity of our background job queuing service to prevent issues like this in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
Are you connected to VRBO OTA?
Starting today at 2pm UTC, we will be fetching guest reviews and ratings from VRBO, and you'll be able to respond to them directly from Smily interface :)
🚧 Pain Points Addressed:
No need to visit VRBO to check and respond to guest reviews.
Previously, you couldn't rate a guest.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Manage all your reviews in one place.
Easily read and respond to VRBO guest reviews from our Review section on the Smily interface.
Rate guests with ease.
ℹ️ Information and next steps:
We will fetch all your past reviews.


You will be able to rate all past bookings matching those criteria:
--> Bookings without guest review that ended in the last 365 days;
--> Bookings for which a guest review is already present and 14 days haven’t passed since the guest made the review;


Make use of this new feature and ensure to leave reviews for guests. This is an important criterion for VRBO and will impact your property ranking.


Lastly, you can use our "automated reviews" feature, released at the end of last year, for VRBO reviews too.


Have a great review day,
Your Smily team :)]]></summary>

Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with the DigitalOcean Container Registry service. Beginning around 20:00 UTC on February 20, there has been an uptick in 401 errors for image pulls from the Container Registry service.
During this time, a subset of customers may experience latency or see 401 errors while interacting with Container Registries. This issue also impacts App Platform builds and users may encounter delays while building their Apps or experience timeout errors in builds as a result. Users utilizing Container Registry for images for deployment to Managed Kubernetes clusters may also see latency or failures to deploy.

Starting around 12:46 PM PST on February 6, 2024, until around 4:06 PM PST on February 9, 2024, some users experienced issues with their profile pictures loading, resulting in the default avatar image displaying instead of their custom image.

We identified a bug that caused missing image data from a database cache. We fixed the bug and reset the backend cache to pull new data, which initially fixed the issue around 4:00 PM PST on February 6. However, some users began experiencing the problem again once their Slack client refreshed.

We continued investigating the issue, tracing it back to a piece of code that would push older image data to a database that housed profile information, and promptly reverted the incorrect code which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

We are thrilled to share with you some great news :)
We are now supporting and managing Booking.com Sponsored Benefit program at Smily;
Benefits for you:
You were facing the obstacle where booking.com **was paying a small amount of the booking.com reservation due to a discount offered to the guest.
1/ it was not blocking the synchronisation of your listing but was creating an issue for the payment;
2/ you had to send manually a payment link to collect the remaining amount to the guests. This won’t be necessary anymore!


Now, as we do support the Sponsored benefit program, you will still see and receive this small amount in advance paid by Booking.com and we will process with success the rest of the payment!


You can now join this program if you were waiting for this functionality 🙂
How does this program benefit your business?
When applied, it offers the following advantages for your business:
Boosts bookings from price-conscious customers
Lowers cancellations with customers paying in advance
Increases your revenue by covering the reduced amount to drive more bookings
Take the next step:
Take a look at what this program is about and check out if you are eligible to enable it and enjoy it;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
The Airbnb Listing expectation type feature is now available on Smily. 
This update lets you enrich your listings with additional information, directly from Smily's user-friendly interface.
Pain Points Addressed:
Gone are the days of toggling between platforms. Previously, you had to navigate Airbnb's website to update listing details, a time-consuming and inefficient process. Smily's new feature streamlines this, offering a seamless integration within the interface.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Easily accessible under the "amenities" section in the Smily interface, the new "Property Info" category empowers you to select and customize expectation types, with an optional description of up to 100 characters.
This information is then flawlessly synced with Airbnb for those using full synchronization, ensuring a cohesive and accurate listing.
It will also be synchronised on your website if you have one with Smily!
Such information is key and valuable for the guests to avoid any negative surprises on check-in day!
→ Here is where to find this new section on the Smily interface👇
-> Then click on the pen to edit/add an optional description;

ℹ️ Next steps and important information
For those using this via Airbnb, we've already fetched your existing listing expectations from Airbnb as of February 9th.


To ensure data alignment with this new feature, please update any changes made since then before our official release on February 21st via the Smily interface;
→ On February 21st, we will start the synchronisation of your data from Smily to the Airbnb application. Any values not reflected on the Smily interface will be removed from Airbnb.


Please note, that the Smily interface allows a description limit of 100 characters compared to Airbnb's 300. Should this affect your listings, we'll reach out individually.
→ if you cannot update your description before February 21st, let us know please;


Have a great day,
Your Smily team :)]]></summary>

On February 12, 2024 from 6:00 AM PST to 8:32 AM PST, some users experienced latency when loading canvases or errors related to editing and saving canvases.

Resolved - On February 9, 2024 between 10:34 UTC and 11:24 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded and 63% of webhooks were delayed by up to 16 minutes with an average delay of 5 minutes. No webhook deliveries were lost. This was due to an issue with an overloaded backend data store that was unable to process network requests fast enough.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over traffic to healthy hosts.
We are expanding the capacity of the backing store as well as making the Webhooks service more resilient to this kind of issue. 

Feb  9, 11:25 UTC
Update - Webhooks is operating normally.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Feb  6, 17:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Feb  2, 20:23 UTC
Scheduled - Start Time: 17:00 UTC Feb 6, 2024
End Time: 00:00 UTC Feb 7, 2024
During the above time, our Engineering Team will be performing maintenance to failover some internal databases from one cluster to another.
Extensive testing has been conducted to ensure this maintenance will be successful and result in minimal impact to DigitalOcean users. The actual failover is estimated to take less than 3 seconds.
Existing infrastructure, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, should continue running without issue. There is no network disruption to existing services expected as part of this maintenance. However, there are dependencies on multiple services. During the failover, there may be customer impacts that should be brief and transitory. The following actions may experience increased latency or failure rates during the maintenance period:
- API calls to the DigitalOcean public API 
- Events for Droplets and Droplet-based services such as create, delete, power on/off, resize, etc 
- Control operations through the DigitalOcean Cloud Control Panel 
Multiple teams will be engaged to keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate any impact that does occur. We’ll post updates here for any unexpected changes to this scheduled maintenance, as well as progress updates during the maintenance itself.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.]]></summary>

Resolved - On 2024-02-05, from 09:26 to 13:20 UTC some GitHub customers experienced errors when trying to download raw files. An overloaded server exposed a bug, causing us to return HTTP 500 error codes.
The issue was mitigated by disabling the server and re-routing traffic. We are implementing improvements to our routing logic to more quickly avoid troublesome hosts in the future.
