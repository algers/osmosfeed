On April 20th, 2023 from 6:00 AM PDT until 7:45 AM PDT, a small number of users experienced latency issues when using Slack. Users reported a delay in loading threads, channels, direct messages, marking messages as read, and executing workflows. 


The issue resulted from an increased database load on one of our data center regions. We made a change in order manage the larger load and return to normal response times. 


Our team is continuing to look into what causes some queries to run slower than others to prevent degraded performance in the future.

We are happy to announce that new damage deposit payment settings are now available in your Smily account. Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.
Why the changes?
Up until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings > Payments > Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.
Both options led to the damage deposit being due via the Smily payment link, and to wrong information being displayed on the Smily payment page and the Smily booking contract in case you were managing your damage deposit via a partner app such as Swikly.

On April 16rd, 2023 from 12:11 PM PDT until 14:39 PM PDT, certain Android users on the Free plan reported issues with loading channels in the Android app.  


Upon investigation, this was attributed to the implementation of a data optimization feature, intended to improve app performance. We have rolled back this feature temporarily, which has corrected the observed issue.  A full investigation and remedy will take place prior to reimplementation.

What happened?
Tailscale mapped tailnets created by GitHub organizations to their organization name, rather than to their organization ID. This meant that if a GitHub organization was renamed, and the previous name taken over by a new GitHub organization, the existing tailnet would be tied to the new GitHub organization instead of the original one.
Who is affected?
Up to 1,305 tailnets created by GitHub organizations may have been affected, if those GitHub organizations were renamed between 2021-06-18 and 2023-03-30 and fully relinquished the old GitHub organization name. Additiona…]]></summary>

On March 21, 2023 at 7:32 AM PDT to March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT, the "Time when workflow started" variable is missing from all steps of the Workflow Builder for new and existing workflows. If the variable was used to publish to a Google Sheet, the cell would be empty.


We discovered a bug that made date fields invisible without any errors displayed, though workflows were still running and had access to the value.


We have released a fix on March 22, 2023 at 8:06 AM PDT. Previously impacted workflows need to retrieve the timestamps from the workflow in the Workflow Builder. We appreciate your patience while we sorted this out.]]></summary>
