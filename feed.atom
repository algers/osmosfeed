        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Incident began at <strong>2022-09-07 16:04</strong> and ended at <strong>2022-09-08 06:29</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class="cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text"><h1>Incident Report</h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>On 07 September 2022, Google Workspace experienced an issue where the existing and new users, who had Gmail recently enabled for them, between 09:04 US/Pacific and 19:11 US/Pacific had a delay before they were able to access Gmail. To our Workspace customers whose users were impacted, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.</p>
<p><strong>Root Cause:</strong></p>
<p>Workspace uses a roster management and indexing API to easily manage, view users, and manage Access Control List (ACL) based on a list of users. When there is a change in a group membership of a user, the API will send a notification. The notification is then compiled by the compilation engine and the output of the compilation is sent to a backend setting service which is used by different Workspace apps to determine whether an app is enabled for a given user and to provide users with appropriate access to the app.</p>
<p>A recent rollout to the roster management backend database inadvertently introduced an issue which generated unnecessary notification traffic on user computation. When membership changes are made to a large roster, all of its descendants need to be recomputed, generating a lot of backend notifications that need to be recomputed and updated. The trigger for the issue was a membership change request from a large customer which required compilation of a large number of user changes.</p>
<p>This caused rapid compilation of app settings for the same customer in a very short time interval putting excessive load on database partitions holding the relevant data thus creating a hotspot. The hotspotting caused delays in compilation of user settings across Workspace applications.</p>
<p><strong>Remediation and Prevention:</strong></p>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 07 September 2022 at 09:37 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 11:57 US/Pacific, engineers identified the hotspotting issue and narrowed down the trigger. At 13:05 US/Pacific, engineers began mitigating the hotspotting by manual intervention. By 13:59, the compilation success rate had improved and started processing the backlog. The backlog gradually progressed and completed for all the affected customers at 19:11 US/Pacific resolving the issue.</p>
<p>Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent a future recurrence by taking the following actions:</p>
<p>Enhance the compilation scheduling design for better fairness and isolation of customer requests.
Enhance debugging tools so that on-call engineers can quickly identify the issues from compilation logs.
Complete rollout to fix the issue with the roster management backend database.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Description of Impact:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gmail:</strong>
Google Workspace users, including newly created users that had Gmail newly enabled for them, between 09:04 US/Pacific and 19:11 US/Pacific on 7 September 2022 experienced a delay before they were able to access Gmail.</p>
<p><strong>Other Workspace apps:</strong>
Users may have experienced delays in accessing other Workspace apps after those apps were enabled for them. Our analysis did not reveal any noticeable errors for other Workspace apps.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:


Starting September 6th, 2022, we identified an issue with the Google Sheet app inside Workflow Builder. This issue caused the app to read the spreadsheet date/time format wrong, inserting the incorrect time value in the timestamp.


We discovered this was due to the app processing the workflow step with a single digit value instead of a double digit value.


Users can continue highlighting the Submission Time column in the spreadsheet and select Format → Number → Custom Number Format and insert: ddd mmm yyyy hh:mm:ss, as a workaround.


We will work to fix this through a bug ticket that has been filed as a result of this incident. Though we have not resolved this issue yet, we will provide further updates through customer support tickets with the impacted users.]]></summary>

On September 1st, 2022 from around 6:28 am to September 7th, 2022 around 3:00 pm PDT, some users on the Slack desktop app version 4.28.171 installed via the Windows Store were receiving an error when attempting to connect to Slack. 


We determined the cached information typically used to launch the app became corrupted, and subsequently caused the app to not load through a network request, prompting an error instead of re-trying the connection. We then launched a fix that allowed the app to re-attempt a network request, which solved the issue.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
Today, we are glad to announce yet a new feature: a brand new Dashboard section that will allow you to easily manage your daily tasks, directly from your Smily account.
Here is a sneak peek at what the new Dashboard looks like:

In the past, managing day to day operations may have been complicated. Tasks such as keeping track of payments, approving pending tentatives and others were time consuming.
Thanks to the Dashboard, you now have access to the following information:
List of pending tentatives: to help you convert them into confirmed bookings, or cancel them to free up the dates in your calendar
List of bookings with missing payments: to help you get all your payments on time and never miss a payment again
List of arrivals of the day: to help you plan the check-in of your guests
List of departures of the day: to help you plan the check-out of your guests
You can find more details in the dedicated manual article, and a video guided tour of the new Dashboard section will soon be added there as well.
We invite you to explore this new Dashboard, and hope it will help you save time and better manage your daily operations. Some improvements will also be made in the future, such as adding performance metrics to help you manage your business more easily.]]></summary>

From Monday August 29 at 10:11 AM PDT to Wednesday August 31st at 12:42 PM PDT, some Grid customers were running into errors when configuring SSO settings for their workspaces.

From August 29, 2022 at 11:26 AM PDT to August 30, 2022 at 3:56 PM PDT, some customers may have experienced issues with their Mark as Read preferences, and intermittent issues loading channel history.


When you view a channel, Slack remembers your last scroll position so we can take you back to the same place. A recent feature update inadvertently bypassed the check for this scroll position, creating the impression that Slack wasn't respecting your Mark as Read preference. Additionally, this incorrectly prevented channel history from loading for some users.


We identified the root cause and rolled this code change back, resolving the issue for all affected customers.]]></summary>

On August 23, 2022 between 12:17 PM PDT and 1:32 PM PDT, some customers experienced difficulty with loading Slack and sending messages. This occurred when a group of database servers became overloaded and failed.


We first reduced the load on our infrastructure manually. The issue was then resolved when our automated processes kicked in, replacing the damaged server with a healthy one.
