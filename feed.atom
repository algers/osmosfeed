Update - We have now completed our investigation and identified that the issue affected a small percentage of Make users and their organizations. We are preparing to update all impacted customers with information about the scenarios and particular executions that may have produced incorrect data in the Data Store. We expect to update all impacted customers in the next 24 hours.
Sep 20, 14:50 CEST
Update - We have confirmed that this issue did not impact private and OEM instances. We are currently working to identify all affected customers in Make multi-tenant zones (eu1.make.com, eu2.make.com, eu1.make.celonis.com, us1.make.com, us1.make.celonis.com). Once we have identified these customers, we will contact them and post an update here to explain the issue and any ongoing impact. We will share the next update as soon as we can.

Update - We are currently in the process of locating impacted scenarios. Once the full list is obtained further communications will be sent.

Update - We have identified an issue with the "Update a Record" module in the Data store app. In the period of September 18th 7:16pm CET until September 19th 12:00pm, the module might have produced incorrect output and data store records that were updated during this period may have been incorrectly stored (only the updated values for a given record were stored while other values were cleared). We are investigating the scope of impact and will provide more information in the next update.

Identified - The issue has been identified and a fix has been implemented. We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…]]></summary>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary: 

On August 24, 2023 between 10:41 AM PDT to 4:10 PM PDT, channel sections were missing from some users' sidebars.


We determined that a recent update in code failed to process an older format of data objects coming from our cache.


While we reverted this change and saw the majority of the issue resolved, this action caused an issue localized to the new data format and some users were still affected. 


Once we pushed a fix to normalize and handle all objects in the cache, channel sections were restored for all impacted users.]]></summary>

On August 4, 2023 from 8:04 AM PDT to 11:14 AM PDT, some users were unable to upload files in Slack.


We determined that a recent backend code change was erroneously detecting certain users as deactivated, which in turn was causing these users requests to upload files to be rejected. We reverted this change, which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>
