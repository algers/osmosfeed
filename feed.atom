<p>We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/support">https://cloud.google.com/support</a>  or to Google Workspace Support using help article <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213">https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213</a>.</p>
<p>(All Times US/Pacific)</p>
<p><strong>Incident Start:</strong> 5 May 2023 12:02</p>
<p><strong>Incident End:</strong> 5 May 2023 12:58</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 56 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Affected Services and Features:</strong></p>
<p>Gmail, Google Cloud Networking</p>
<p><strong>Regions/Zones:</strong> Multi Region Europe</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Multiple Google services, including GCP and Workspace, experienced an outage for a duration of up to 56 minutes in and around Spain/Morocco. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a Google initiated network routing change at the edge of our network there. The issue was mitigated at 12:58 by removing the problematic routers from service, forcing traffic to use other paths.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Impact:</strong></p>
<h4>GCP</h4>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud Networking experienced a full outage for all internet service providers (ISPs) connected to two peering routers in Madrid, Spain.</li>
<li>All GCP services were unavailable for users reaching GCP from impacted ISP(s) until mitigation in and around Spain/Morocco.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Workspace</h4>
<ul>
<li>Some Gmail customers had delivery delays and availability issues during the outage in Spain.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your service or application was affected, we apologize — this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we have taken and are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>

Our upstream provider will continue to work to fully resolve this issue, but at this time, we have not been provided an ETA. Until we receive communication from them, traffic will remain shifted away to alternate providers to mitigate user impact. 
Due to this, we will go ahead and close out this incident. The traffic shift to reintroduce upstream providers, when it occurs, should be seamless for users in the SFO regions.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed full resolution of this incident. 
Reports show that from approximately 20:00 UTC on May 8th to 02:30 UTC on May 9th, DNS resolution was inoperative for services in our SFO1 region. 
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from within your Cloud Control Panel.
Resolved: May 09, 2023 - 03:42 UTC
-
Our Engineering team identified an issue with the path that resolver traffic was taking for our SFO1 region, resulting in services in SFO1 being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. A fix has been put in place and we've confirmed that DNS resolution is now functioning normally.
We're now monitoring the situation and will post an update shortly once we confirm full resolution of this incident.
Monitoring: May 09, 2023 - 02:49 UTC
-
Our Engineering team is investigating user reports of services in our SFO1 region being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. This includes running commands on Droplets that utilize DNS lookups, such as "wget" and "apt update", etc. Inbound network connections to services should still be operating normally. 
Thank you for your patience as our team works to understand the root cause of the issue. We'll post an update once we have further information.

Expected impact:
This maintenance is designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic during the maintenance period. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services would experience a temporary loss of connectivity over the public network. Services in the TOR1 region could also experience issues with management of events such as power on/off, snapshots, and backups etc. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device
reauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to
lose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.
What happened?
The logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an
already-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the
device’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s
identity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without
any tags.
The bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on
2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.
Who is affected?
189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either
directly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast
user switching to switch between multiple
tailnets.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security
contacts.
What is the impact?
Devices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the
device’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,
or the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the
device. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab
of the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this
could change the device’s network permissions.
We have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of
deliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect
outcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.
What do I need to do?
If you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were
contacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the
admin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix
to the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected
organizations.]]></summary>

We are happy to announce that new damage deposit payment settings are now available in your Smily account. Those new settings will allow you to better manage your damage deposit payments, as well as provide a better experience to your guests.
Why the changes?
Up until now, when going to your general damage deposit payment management settings (in Settings > Payments > Default preferences), the only option available regarding the collection of your damage deposit was the collection time: either with bookings payment or on arrival.

On April 16rd, 2023 from 12:11 PM PDT until 14:39 PM PDT, certain Android users on the Free plan reported issues with loading channels in the Android app.  


Upon investigation, this was attributed to the implementation of a data optimization feature, intended to improve app performance. We have rolled back this feature temporarily, which has corrected the observed issue.  A full investigation and remedy will take place prior to reimplementation.

The scheduled maintenance has been completed.

During the above window, we will be performing maintenance in our AMS3 region as part of network upgrades.
Expected Impact:
We will have a loss of redundancy for all network connectivity heading into and out of all AMS data centers. Since this loss of redundancy will occur when traffic levels are lowest, we do not expect any impact on availability or bandwidth. Should an issue occur, we will update our status page with details.
