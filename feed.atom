<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On 24 July 2023 at 07:50, following a Google Classroom iOS app update,  the app would not load properly if users attempted to access any course page that had attached materials for a duration of 1 day, 20 hours, 25 minutes. During the disruption, users were able to access course pages by uninstalling and reinstalling the Classroom iOS app.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>The root cause has been identified as a bug, triggered by an update released for Classroom iOS, that caused an issue with the local database migration. This caused the iOS app to not load properly when users attempted to access course pages with attached materials, as the migration was specific to the materials configuration.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to the issue via internal monitoring on 24 July 2023 at 07:50 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers reproduced the issue,  identified the trigger as a failed database migration, and paused the auto update. This prevented any further disruption. An app update with a fix was released for the Classroom iOS app, thereby resolving the issue on 26 July 2023 at 04:15 US/Pacific. Users who had already updated to the problematic app version were advised to either uninstall and reinstall or update the app to the version with the fix.</p>
<p>Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement additional pre-release migration and application testing plans to validate app stability</li>
</ul>

From July 26th, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT to July 28th 2023 at 1:00PM PDT some users had trouble loading and editing canvases when accessing them from the channel canvas icon.


We determined this issue was caused by a recent code change related to how canvases persist across sessions. We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users. To see the fix applied, user impacted users should press Command/Control + R. We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.]]></summary>

On July 27, 2023 between 2:03 AM PDT - 2:59 AM PDT, Slack was experiencing a systemwide issue during which users were not able to send or receive messages across multiple platforms. 


Our engineering team identified an issue after a change was made to a service that manages our internal system communication. This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. 


We are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future. More information about remediation and prevention steps will be included in an upcoming RCA which you can request by writing into feedback@slack.com.]]></summary>

We would like to inform you that we will deploy a nice improvement to your websites.
Starting today, all Smily websites will be under SSL certificates.
There is nothing you have to do on your side, this change will be automatic and shall not impact your website’s accessibility.
What does it mean ?
Your website’s URL will be starting with https:// and no longer http://.
What are the benefits of this change ?
Websites are more secured
Better user experience
Users stay longer and buy more on secured websites
Sites with HTTPS load faster
HTTPS leads to accurate SEO reporting
Better SEO : SSL is a positive ranking factor for Google. Google’s team has expressed the need for HTTPS time and time again. So much so that they’ve released an algorithm update based on it—causing sites without HTTPS security to struggle on their quest to rank highly in the search engines results.

On July 6, 2023 between 06:21 AM PDT and 10:58 AM PDT, some users were experiencing issues with messages sent with an attached file and app mention. They were incorrectly displaying an error "This message contains interactive elements".


As we looked into it further, we traced the problem to a formatting issue, which resulted in missing metadata for the messages sent. Reverting a recent change fixed the issue for all affected customers.]]></summary>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.

Hello, 
During the above window, our Engineering team will be performing maintenance on redundant upstream electrical systems in order to improve reliability in our FRA1 region.
Expected Impact:
We don't expect to see any downtime as the power to hypervisors are redundant. In a highly unlikely situation, where we lose power to both the supplies, the Droplets in FRA1 may experience downtime for a brief period. We will endeavor to keep this to a minimum for the duration of the change.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket
Thank you,
Team DigitalOcean]]></summary>
