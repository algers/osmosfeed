From Monday December 12, 2022 at 10:27 AM PST to Monday December 19, 2022 at 1:30 PM PST, we began investigating reports of messages being marked as read when backgrounding the iOS app while in a conversation. As a result, the sidebar would not show unread messages next to the DM/Channel/Threads view. 


We have now made a change on our end that resolved the issue and released a fix on iOS app version 22.12.21. Users on the iOS app should now be able to receive messages without them being marked as read automatically.]]></summary>

At Smily, we are here to help you Save time and Book more! That's why we are always thrilled to announce new features 🎉
Over the past few years, more and more channels have allowed you to set the check-in instructions, to coordinate a smooth and seamless arrival with your guests.
The check-in types were not synchronized with Smily, preventing you from adding this critical information to your listings.
After several requests and feedback, we created a new field on the rental base where you can add your check-in type. 

This feature is now synchronized with your website and our top partners, Airbnb, Booking.com, VRBO, and Expedia.
Add your check-in types in Smily and provide your guests with a smoother check-in experience!

We determined this issue was caused by a recent frontend change that caused a failure to load videos via the streaming protocol HLS (Hypertext Live Streaming), for which no fallback existed. 


To resolve this issue, we introduced a fallback to HLS allowing users to play video files with a slightly degraded experience, such as longer load times. 


Additionally, we disabled a code optimization technique which fully restored HLS functionality for all users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue Summary:


On December 14, 2022 from 4:30 AM PST to 9:00 AM PST, we received reports from customers who were unable to receive SMS 2FA codes to log into Slack. 


We discovered that the Slack queue on a third party 2FA service, and associated outgoing SMS message errors, were growing at a high rate. Customers who had enabled 2FA via SMS were affected in at least India, China, US, Brazil, and Argentina. We identified that a majority of traffic was coming from bad actors, whose requests led to unusually high volume for our queue. 


We prevented these individuals from accessing Slack, while our 2FA service provider implemented a change to further mitigate strain on our queue. These actions resolved the issue for all impacted customers.

From 10:12 AM PST until 10:25 AM PST on December 14, 2022, some customers had trouble loading Slack workspaces, sending messages, and uploading files.


Prior to this issue, we began removing traffic from an isolated location within a data center region as part of a planned exercise. Upon further investigation, we identified a bug within this process. We then stopped the process, which resolved the issue for all users. Error rates were monitored for a short while prior to announcing the resolution, in order to ensure the issue was fully resolved and would not reoccur.]]></summary>
