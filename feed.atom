Resolved - On November 21, 2023, at 09:50 UTC GitHub Actions jobs encountered delays due to an incident in our background job service caused by excessive rebalancing in a Kafka consumer group. After a quick mitigation, we began to see recovery on the job queues by 10:02 UTC. During this time window 100% of Actions jobs were delayed in starting for up to 11 minutes.
Unfortunately, the rapid queue recovery sent a thundering herd of jobs to Actions hosted runner pools, causing a database deadlock that resulted in some hosted runner pools having increased latency when accepting new jobs. This affected only a small percentage of overall jobs, around 2%. Configuration changes led to a resolution and the system was fully recovered by 11:27 UTC and all in progress jobs were processed.
The incident is now resolved.
Nov 21, 11:12 UTC
Update - We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.
Nov 21, 10:24 UTC
Update - We have recovery for the underlying issue but are waiting for Actions queues to catch up. We expect this to be completed in less than 1 hour(s).
Nov 21, 10:11 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions]]></summary>

On November 8, 2023 from 7:55 AM PT until 8:27 PM PT, a small number of users experienced errors when attempting to join or start huddles.


We traced this back to an unexpected spike in a database load for which we quickly saw recovery.


We monitored the situation closely and in an effort to prevent further unexpected error spikes, we implemented a strategic configuration adjustment to optimize the load on our database.

This issue started on Nov 16 around 12:00 AM PST and was resolved on Nov 17 at 9:10 AM PST, and we expect this to be fully resolved. Please contact us if you are still seeing this issue.]]></summary>

Resolved - On 2023-11-15, from 09:44 to 10:42 UTC, some GitHub customers experienced increased latency or errors accessing repo data.
High concurrent access to a specific git object exposed a bug that forced a backend service to perform excessive calculations, overloading the service. Access to this repo was paused while load was re-rerouted, mitigating the problem.
The conditions that triggered the expensive operations have been identified and refactored.
Nov 15, 11:33 UTC
Update - Error rates and performance have returned to normal.
Nov 15, 11:21 UTC
Update - We have identified the source of the issue and have removed the additional load from the service. Sporadic delays in pull request experiences and intermittent 500s are still occurring and impacting a very small percentage of traffic. Next update is expected within 30 minutes.
Nov 15, 11:04 UTC
Update - We are seeing connectivity issues between some of our systems and git backend services. This is causing intermittent error responses and delays in pull request experiences for a very small percentage of traffic. We are investigating mitigations and expect to provide another update within 30 minutes.

From 3:15 PM PST on November 14, 2023 to around 4:13 PM PST, a small number of customers using the Slack desktop app were unable to connect to Slack. This may have manifested as a "Something's gone awry" error page.


A recent code change inadvertently introduced a logic error that prevented the desktop app from connecting as expected. We reverted this code change as an immediate mitigation step, then rolled out a fix to correct the logic error.

Nov  3, 19:43 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. Upstream congestion with a network provider between Los Angeles and Dallas is impacting traffic traversing out of our SFO datacentres.
A case has been opened by our team with the provider. Our team has attempted to shift traffic to improve the situation, but unfortunately, we continue to see approximately 10% of customer traffic impacted by this issue.
Our team is working on an option to shift to an alternate provider if this issue is not able to be resolved by the provider in a timely manner. We will share another update once we have further information from the provider or we have an update from our Engineering team.
Nov  3, 19:27 UTC
Investigating - As of 17:40 UTC, our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting networking in the SFO regions. During this time, a subset of users may experience packet loss/latency and timeouts with Droplet based services in these regions, including Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Managed Database.

Resolved - A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacte…]]></summary>

From 5:01 PM PDT on October 31, 2023 to around 5:54 PM PDT, customers with international data residency in the Paris, France region, experienced issues connecting to Slack and sending messages.


A routine credential rotation caused database sync issues for the Paris, France data residency region. We reverted this code change and restarted the affected databases, resolving the issue for all impacted customers. 


Once we had mitigated the immediate impact and restored connectivity for customers in the Paris, France data residency region, we reviewed the credential rotation for all other data residency regions to ensure the same issue would not occur anywhere else.

Kubernetes operator’s API proxy allowed authenticated tailnet clients

Tailscale Kubernetes operator version v1.53.37 fixes the issue and
users of the operator who enable the API proxy functionality should
update as described below.
What happened?
The Tailscale Kubernetes operator can optionally act as an API server
proxy
for the cluster’s Kubernetes API. This proxy allows authenticated
tailnet users to use their tailnet identity in Kubernetes
authentication and RBAC rules. The API server proxy uses
impersonation

to translate tailnet identities to Kubernetes identities.

These classifications are false positives, and we are working with Microsoft to
resolve the situation.
As of 2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC, we have confirmed that Microsoft have addressed
the false positive, meaning Defender no longer flags Tailscale 1.46.1 as
malware. A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.
What happened?
Microsoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware. This caused
Defender to quarantine the binaries, meaning they could not run.
We submitted Tailscale 1.46.1 to Microsoft to investigate the false positive,
who then updated Defender to avoid flagging this release as malware at
2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC.
Who is affected?
People using Defender and Tailscale 1.46.1.
What is the impact?
Tailscale will not run on affected machines.
What do I need to do?
To resolve this issue on your own tailnet, you can take either or both of 2
approaches:
Update to a newer version of Tailscale. Newer versions are not affected by this problem.
Create an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.
Update Microsoft Defender.]]></summary>

Resolved - Copilot completions are currently hosted in 4 regions globally: Central US, France, Switzerland and Japan. Users are typically routed to the nearest geographic region, but may be routed to other regions when the nearest region is unhealthy.
Beginning at 2023-10-25 09:13 UTC, Copilot began experiencing outages of individual regions, lasting 12 minutes per region. These outages were due to the nodes hosting the completion model getting unhealthy due to a recent upgrade. There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors. The outages were partial and varied across the different regions.
In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we are focusing on improving our global load balancing of completion traffic during regional failures, in addition to determining and preventing the root cause of these outages.
