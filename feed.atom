Tired of billing problems taking up a lot of your time? We understand!
Not long ago, we introduced some changes to our pricing model, which now takes into account your Gross Booking Value (GBV) and adjusts your monthly fee accordingly. Since this change, we understand that you’ve experienced some issues with your monthly payments to Smily and that this has been incredibly frustrating for you.
We are working hard to improve your payments experience, so that you no longer have to spend your time and energy solving payment issues.
We’re very happy to announce the first in a series of changes to the way in which you pay for Smily.

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data.

On August 28, 2023 from 4:30 AM PDT to 10:30 AM PDT, less than 1% of Slack users encountered slowness when loading channels, DMs, and threads. Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.


We found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. 


We restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. 


We're continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: An issue in the Tailscale client, combined with a behavior
of the UPnP implementations in some routers, could expose all UDP ports of a
node to external networks (usually the internet).
As of 2023-08-22 2:30 AM UTC, we have changed the Tailscale coordination server
to advise nodes to stop using UPnP for port mapping. In some cases this can
degrade NAT traversal and may cause some connections to route through DERP.
This may increase node-to-node latency and decrease throughput. Version 1.48.1
resolves the issue and re-enables port mapping via UPnP.
What happened?
Tailscale nodes use UPnP as one of the mechanisms to open UDP port forwarding
in routers to help with NAT traversal. Tailscale picks a node port and an
external router port and requests forwarding between them. On firs…]]></summary>

On August 21, 2023 from 8:00 AM PDT to 8:51 AM PDT, less than 1% of users experienced trouble loading Slack.


We determined that a recent code change on our back end was resulting in a higher than expected memory footprint, and that this combined with high traffic loads was causing these issues.


We immediately rolled back this change, which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>
