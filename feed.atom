From Monday March 25, 2024 at 3:30 PM PDT to Tuesday March 26, 2024 until 8:51 AM PDT, some users saw the error message REB686069408 when adding Google Sheets to their workflows.

This was traced to a backend change related to how Workflow Builder searches for a Google Sheet when using the Google Sheets workflow step, but the user interface was not receiving proper label values causing the error. 

We reverted the change as an initial attempt to fix, but learned this didn't resolve the issue as we continued to see incorrect value data.

We corrected the problematic piece of code that allowed for the Google Sheets step to properly search for the spreadsheet using the correct search value. This restored the workflow step to full functionality.]]></summary>

Update - We continue monitoring remaining queued messages. Overall, the system has reached a normal steady state; Now, most messages are sending without any additional queueing delay. However, individual customers may see messages remaining in queues due to large numbers of messages enqueued during this incident. We expect any messages delayed during this incident to have fully propagated through to a final status over the course of the next several hours. Note that we expect that some messages will eventually timeout and fail due to Validity Period Expired (error code 30036), others may eventually fail due to a Twilio Internal Error (error code 30500).
We will provide an update in 8 hours or as soon as more information becomes available.

Completed - Scheduled maintenance has completed ahead of schedule, with no observed customer impact. Thank you for your patience. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.
Mar 26, 17:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Mar 21, 18:15 UTC
Scheduled - Start Time: March 26 17:00 UTC
End Time: March 26 18:00 UTC
During this time, our Engineering Team will be performing maintenance to failover an internal service from one cluster to another. 
This maintenance has been previously conducted with limited impact and our team has done extensive planning and testing to ensure a smooth failover, with the least disruption possible.
Existing infrastructure (including Droplet and Droplet-based services networking) will continue running without issue. 
If the failover period lasts longer than expected, there may be customer impacts with associated services including: 
Droplet creates with a root password
Droplet root password resets 
MongoDB cluster creates 
Let’sEncrypt certificate creation (for Load Balancers and Spaces)
LoadBalancer creation with certificates
Spaces key creation
Marketplace (Add-Ons) will be unavailable for both vendors and users
App Platform builds and deploys may see latency 
Users will be unable to fetch CSV invoices 
Bulk actions in the Spaces UI
At this time, we do not expect to see any of the above listed impacts during maintenance, but are prepared for the worst case if needed.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.]]></summary>

Improvement
  
We're thrilled to announce an important update to our monthly billing process, driven by your valuable feedback. 🙌
We understand that receiving multiple invoices for your Smily subscription throughout the month has been an accounting headache for some of our customers. Therefore, we've made changes to streamline our billing process and improve your experience.
Starting immediately, all charges for new rentals will be consolidated onto one invoice, which will be issued on your account renewal date. This means that you will no longer receive separate invoices for each new rental added to your Smily account.
What does this mean for you?
📃 Consolidated Invoicing: on your account renewal date, you will receive an invoice for your Smily subscription for the upcoming month…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:
On March 20, 2024 from around 8:05 AM PDT until 10:33 PM PDT, some users experienced various issues with Slack such as loading channel membership lists, joining a channel, setting or clearing their user statuses, loading profile images, incorrect huddle status, and inconsistent user states if a user was recently deactivated or reactivated.

A recent change to resolve an unrelated traffic issue we observed with our backend servers inadvertently caused connections to database caching services to timeout.

At around 12:00 PM PDT, we had identified the cause of the timeout failures and began gradually deploying a fix. We continued to closely monitor our health metrics for any abnormalities as our remediation progressed.

By 10:33 PM PDT, the deploy successfully reached all affected users, these users would have immediately received the fix through a hard refresh of their Slack client (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R). By 8:49 AM PDT on March 21, 2024, most affected users received the fix without a required hard refresh.

We are continuing to investigate this issue and implement preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of this occurring again in the future.]]></summary>

On March 19, 2024 from 2:50 PM PDT to 8:16 PM PDT, less than 1% of users were unable to load Slack. 

A corrupted table in our database infrastructure prevented one of our databases from responding to requests, causing connection issues for customers whose workspaces were hosted on that database. We manually triggered a backup of the affected database. While we always have backups in place, we were concerned that the existing replicas would be affected by the same bug. We used this manual backup to provision new databases, spinning up several fresh replicas. 

Once the replicas were up and running, we directed traffic from the impacted workspaces to these new databases. This restored access for affected customers. We continued working to address the bug that caused the original issue to prevent this from occurring to any other database.]]></summary>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, 06 March 2024, Google Workspace users experienced elevated errors while accessing user or device setting pages within the Chrome Admin Console for a duration of 1 hour, 27 minutes.</p>
<p>To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>Google Workspace Admin Console uses a backend authentication service to grant privileged access to internal accounts. As part of ongoing efforts to migrate the account authorization workflow to a new backend authentication service, Google engineers identified and cleaned up invalid account role assignments in the configuration.</p>
<p>During this clean up effort, engineers identified a privilege which was undefined in the application manifest and removed it from the configuration. Upon further investigation, engineering confirmed the privilege was mapped to an access control setting used by the Admin Console for Chrome. This change resulted in users being unable to access Chrome user and device settings page.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to the outage via an internal monitoring alert on Wednesday, 06 March 2024 at 15:04 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 15:36 and the incident was fully resolved at 15:59 once the rollback completed.</p>
<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve procedural documentation on how to safely cleanup access control settings from authorization configuration.</li>
<li>Complete thorough investigation of privilege usage for the Admin Console to prevent further issues of this type.</li>
<li>Identify and register a new owner for this privilege in the application manifest and create permission mapping for faster verification in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.</p>
<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, 06 March 2024 from 14:32 to 15:59 US/Pacific, Google Workspace users attempting to work within the Admin Console encountered an HTTP 500 error when accessing user or device setting pages within the console.</p>

Resolved - From March 12, 2024 23:39 UTC to March 13, 2024 1:58 UTC, some Pull Requests updates were delayed and did not reflect the latest code that had been pushed. On average, 20% of Pull Requests page loads were out of sync and up to 30% of Pull Requests were impacted at peak. An internal component of our job queueing system was incorrectly handling invalid messages, resulting in stalled processing.
We mitigated the incident by shipping a fix to handle the edge case gracefully and allow processing to continue.
Once the fix was deployed at 1:47 UTC, our systems fully caught up with pending background jobs at 1:58 UTC.
We’re working to improve resiliency to invalid messages in our system to prevent future delays for these pull request updates. We are also reviewing our monitoring and observability to identify and remediate these types of failure cases faster.

On March 11, 2024 from 2:43 PM PDT until 3:43 PM PDT some users in workspaces using International Data Residency (IDR) experienced issues with several Slack features, including messages loading or sending, channels appearing blank, canvases loading, huddles connecting, and trouble with some workflows were also noted.

We identified a spike in error rates that was tied to a recent change to a backend service configuration logic. This change resulted in a cache discrepancy between services causing the errors. We rolled back the recent changes which immediately reduced error rates, resolving the issue for affected users. We are working on modifying the service handler in an effort to reduce the likelihood of this occurring in the future.]]></summary>

On March 11, 2024 at 3:00 PDT to March 12, 2024 at 12:00 AM PDT, some users had trouble completing workflows that contained either text or drop-down fields due to a bug that caused the cursor to revert to the previous field in the workflow.

Upon investigation, we discovered a recent code change that introduced this bug. We rolled back the change and pushed a fix to all users resolving the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mar 11, 19:22 UTC
Resolved - On March 11, 2024 between at 18:44 UTC and 19:10 UTC, GitHub Actions performance was degraded and some users experienced errors when trying to queue workflows. Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.
The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.
We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.

Mar 11, 19:21 UTC
Update - Actions experienced a period of decreased workflow run throughput, and we are seeing recovery now.  We are in the process of investigating the cause.
Mar 11, 19:02 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions]]></summary>

Resolved - On March 11, 2024, between 06:30 UTC and 11:45 UTC the Copilot Chat service was degraded and customers may have encountered errors or timed out requests for chat interactions. On average, the error rate was 10% and peaked at 45% of requests to the service for short periods of time.
This was due to a gap in handling an edge case for messages returned from the underlying language models. We mitigated the incident by applying a fix to the handling of the streaming response.
We are working to update monitoring to reduce time to detection and increase resiliency to message format changes.
Mar 11, 10:02 UTC

Scheduled - Start: 2024-03-05 14:00 UTC
End:  2024-03-05 15:00 UTC
During the above window, we will be performing maintenance in our BLR1 region as part of a firewall migration. This maintenance was previously attempted on 2024-02-19 but the changes were reverted after our Engineers encountered unexpected issues, resulting from the maintenance. Our team has performed a thorough examination of the previous attempt and is confident in performing this maintenance, as well as measures to mitigate any negative outcomes. 
Expected impact:
As part of this maintenance, event processing in BLR1 will be delayed for a period of up to 15 minutes during the one-hour window. During this period, users will experience a delay with creating, destroying, or modifying new or existing DO services in BLR1(such as Droplets, DBaaS/DOKS clusters, etc.), existing services that are running should not be impacted.

Resolved - On March 1, 2024, between 17:00 UTC and 17:42 UTC, we saw elevated failure rates (from 1 to 10%) for Copilot, Actions, Pages, and Git for various APIs.
This incident was triggered by a newly-discovered failure mode of a deployment pipeline to one of our compute clusters when it could not write a specific configuration file. This caused a drop in the amount of resources available in this cluster, which was mitigated by a redeployment.
We have addressed the specific scenario to ensure resources are properly written and retrieved and added safeguards to ensure the deployment does not proceed if there is an issue of this type.  We are also reviewing our systems to more effectively route traffic toward healthy clusters during an outage and adding more safeguards on cluster resource adjustments.

Resolved - On March 1, 2024, between 14:17 UTC and 15:54 UTC the service that sends messages from our event stream into our background job processing service was degraded and delayed the transmission of jobs for processing.  No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.
We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.

On February 29, 2024 from 1:28 PM PST to around 4:36 PM PST, users were unable to create or update some workflows.

We determined that a recent code change had inadvertently introduced a logic problem, resulting in errors for workflows that used event triggers. We reverted this code change. However, rolling back reintroduced a separate issue that we'd resolved earlier in the day. 

We prepared a tailored revert to roll back the code causing the workflow problem while also including the fix for the previous issue. This second revert resolved both problems, restoring full functionality to Slack.

Resolved - On February 29, 2024, between 9:32 and 11:54 UTC, queuing in our background job service caused processing delays to Webhooks, Actions, and Issues. Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.
We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.

On February 26, 2024 from 9:00 AM PST to 9:36 AM PST, some users experienced problems sending and loading messages in Slack. Others may have completed these actions successfully but more slowly than expected.

Earlier today, we deployed a routine update to part of our network infrastructure. During this work, we deprovisioned some of our proxy servers and provisioned a new set. Some of our webapp servers took longer than expected to sync with the new list of proxy servers, resulting in a spike in connection errors. This coincided with the regular 9:00 AM PST increase in traffic to our servers, which may have exacerbated impact.

By around 9:36 AM PST, error rates had decreased and user impact had completely subsided, most likely due to our automatic scaling functionality. However, we're continuing to analyze data from this event to fully understand the root cause and prevent similar issues in the future.]]></summary>

Resolved - On Monday, February 26th, from 20:45 UTC to 21:39 UTC, GitHub Packages reported an outage indicating a degradation in GitHub Container Registry and NPM package upload functionality. Upon investigation, we found a misconfigured observability metric which inadvertently pulled in data from a newly provisioned test environment. All failures being reported were traced back to this test environment. We confirmed that there was no real customer impact to GitHub Packages during this incident. We have since reconfigured our observability metrics to accurately report based on environment.
Feb 26, 21:20 UTC
Update - We are seeing some recovery in NPM and GitHub Container Registry functionality, but are maintaining red status until we are certain issues won’t recur.
Feb 26, 21:03 UTC
Update - NPM and GitHub Container Registry services are degraded, particularly the upload functionality. Investigation is underway.

Resolved - On February 26, 2024, between 18:34 UTC and 19:37 UTC our background job service was degraded and caused job start delays up to 15 minutes. Users experienced delays in Webhooks, Actions, and some UI updates (e.g. a delay in UI updates on pull requests). This was due to capacity problems with our job queueing service, and a failure of our automated failover system.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over to our secondary cluster.   No data was lost - recovery began at 18:55 UTC, when the backlog of enqueued jobs began to process.
We are actively working to repair our failover automation and expand the capacity of our background job queuing service to prevent issues like this in the future.

From 2:58 PM PST on February 22, 2024, until 9:47 PM PST on February 25, 2024, some users were unable to access their workspace billing history.

We traced the issue to a recent backend code change and reverted the change, which fixed the issue for all affected users.

Thank you very much for your patience while we resolved this.]]></summary>
