<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Google Calendar web and mobile users experienced service disruption. These users may have seen “500 Internal” errors when trying to access Calendar on the web main page and while interacting with events for a duration of 3 hours and 15 minutes.  This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>A recent update to Google Calendar triggered an unintended bug that slowed down the service. This was compounded by an increase in invalid internet Calendar Scheduling (ICS) from Gmail to Calendar. As a result, some users may have seen intermittent 500 internal errors while using Google Calendar.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to this issue via internal monitoring on 21 Sept at 06:30 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers mitigated the issue by scaling up Calendar resources and filtering traffic reaching Calendar backends. In addition, we rolled back the recent change in ICS file processing, resulting in traffic returning to normal levels. The issue was fully resolved on 21 Sept at 09:30 US/Pacific.</p>
<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize internal triggers for early performance degradation detection.</li>
<li>Isolate heavy performance processing to dedicated infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>
<p>On 21 Sept from 06:30 to 09:30 US/Pacific, a limited number of Calendar web users experienced intermittent error rates when accessing Calendar, leading to some users not being able to see their event information updated on Calendar.</p>

On September 26, 2023 from 5:00pm PDT to 7:00pm PDT, some users on our new interface design couldn't dismiss an information prompt that read "You now have Later". 


These users also experienced their UI locking, and were unable to click anything in the Slack app. For some, the sparkle animation fixed over the Later icon in the sidebar also persisted longer than intended. 


We identified the root cause as a missing detail in a recent code change. We reverted the change to mitigate the immediate issue, then deployed a fix to fully resolve the problem for all impacted users.]]></summary>

From 7:54 PM PDT on September 22, 2023 to 4:13 PM PDT on September 25, 2023, custom emoji rendered as text for a small number of Enterprise Grid users.


We made a code change that inadvertently introduced unnecessary logging for routine emoji events. This unexpected logging increased traffic to the custom emoji infrastructure, impacting its performance. 


We deployed a fix to remove the unnecessary logging, which reduced traffic to the custom emoji systems and restored normal emoji rendering. 


A small fraction of the affected customers may have experienced lingering issues as the fix was gradually rolled out to everyone.]]></summary>

On September 21, 2023 from 3:00 PM PDT to 8:30 PM PDT, some users encountered a message stating "Something went wrong" when accessing the Slack Connect invites page.

Resolved - On 2023-09-19 at 20:36 UTC, while migrating the primary datastore for Projects, we caused an outage that led to Projects data becoming unavailable for approximately four hours. 
While working to restore Projects data, we also experienced a data replication interruption which affected Git Operations, APIs, and Issues. We first resolved the data replication issue, which returned Git Operations, APIs, and Issues to normal operation. We then restored Projects data to its pre-migration state, and re-inserted data that was added during the period of partial availability. The incident was resolved on 2023-09-20 at 00:06 UTC.
As a result of this incident, we have improved validation of data migrations in test and during rollout.  We have also identified improvements to…]]></summary>

From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.]]></summary>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

Resolved - From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. 
The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.
With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted serv…]]></summary>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoint…]]></summary>

From 11:00 PM PDT on September 1, 2023 to 01:00 AM PDT on September 2, 2023, some users in India may have had issues with the messaging functionality in Slack.
