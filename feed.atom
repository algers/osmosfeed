From 1:43 PM PST on December 19, 2023 to 10:25 AM PST on December 20, 2023, a small number of users experienced seeing blurred file previews. We discovered that this affected users with international data residency enabled in their workspace.

Resolved - At 2023-12-18 20:03 UTC, our monitoring flagged an increase in GitRPC response errors that resulted from a change that was made that caused backend replicas to temporarily become out of sync while the change was deployed. During this time, approximately 2,500 users across 8,200 repos would have seen the merge button disabled or received failures from the merge API endpoint.
Upon discovering the failures, our engineers assessed that the shortest path to resolution was to roll forward and manually deploy to the remaining hosts, which resolved the issue at 2023-12-18 21:26.

Update - Git Operations is operating normally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Incident began at <strong>2023-12-07 18:00</strong> and ended at <strong>2023-12-07 20:32</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class="cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text"><h1>Incident Report</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On 07 December 2023, various Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers experienced intermittent authentication issues when routed to one of our data centers in the US East region. As a result, a limited number of users could not sign-up, login, or re-authenticate for a duration of 1 hour and 32 minutes.</p>
<p>To our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers who were impacted during this issue, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>Google’s authentication stack is broad and deep, running across every region and zone to provide functionality globally across all Google products. This particular issue was scoped to a single microservice&#39;s serving jobs within a single data center; this microservice handles serving some of the user-facing pages involved in sign-up, login, and re-authentication flows.</p>
<p>To improve resource usage efficiency, engineers had been implementing more advanced autoscaling algorithms across these serving jobs globally. These changes were rolled out gradually over a period of several weeks without any issues.</p>
<p>On 7 December, the rollout kicked off rolling restarts across the individual tasks within the serving jobs in a single data center in the US East region. Due to internal network routing at the time, this data center was serving traffic from the US East area as well as South America. These factors placed additional demand on each task&#39;s thread pool, both overloading some tasks and affecting those tasks&#39; ability to report metrics back to load-balancers. This caused requests to be intermittently dropped between the load-balancer and the individual serving tasks; these dropped requests led to user-facing 500 error pages.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted by our internal monitoring system on 07 December at 11:16 US/Pacific and immediately started investigating the issue. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers worked to confirm that traffic could be safely re-routed away from the impacted serving jobs as a mitigation strategy. Traffic was rerouted to other data centers, and the customer impact was mitigated by 12:32 US/Pacific. Our engineers then reviewed and tuned the stability and performance of both this and related serving jobs globally before declaring the incident fully resolved.</p>
<p>Google is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business. We are committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and are completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance metrics and dashboards to make these complex load-balancing dynamics more legible to engineers, reducing the time to mitigate similar future issues.</li>
<li>Improve performance-testing of resource-allocation profiles for each individual serving job</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Google Workspace:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the issue, a limited number Google Workspace users served from this data center had issues with log-in and sign-up for part of unauthenticated traffic, including some users going through &quot;Sign in with Google &#39;&#39; interactive flows using their Google Workspace account</li>
<li>Multiple Google Workspace product log-in attempts, reauthentication attempts, and some new account creation requests from users routed to this data center failed with error 502s.</li>
<li>Users that were already logged in were not affected by the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google OAuth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some users served from this data center intermittently experienced error 502s when attempting to &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; and encountering interactive sign-in or re-authentication flows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google Cloud Console:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A limited number of  users served from this data center experienced error 502s intermittently when attempting to log-in to the Cloud Console.</li>
</ul>
