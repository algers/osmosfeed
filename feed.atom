Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.
Aug 17, 00:44 UTC
Monitoring - The mitigation performed by our Engineering team has been confirmed as resolving customer impact for the issue with VPC's in NYC3. 
We'll continue to monitor for a short period and will post an update once we confirm this issue is fully resolved.
Aug 17, 00:22 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team identified an issue with VPC Connectivity for resources in our NYC3 region. 
Users creating new resources were not able to place them correctly into VPC's in NYC3 via API create requests. Users also saw network connectivity errors between members of NYC3 VPC's. This issue impacted Droplet-based products like Load Balances and Managed Kubernetes clusters as well, manifesting in various VPC-related errors.
Our team was able to mitigate this issue and we're currently monitoring the situation. As of 00:00 UTC, users should see normal VPC behavior in NYC3. 
We apologize for the disruption and will post another update shortly.]]></summary>

Resolved - As of 05:55, our Engineering team has resolved the issue impacting Python builds for the App platform. The users will not be experiencing the error "Requested runtime 'python-3.11.3' is not available for this stack (heroku-18)" during the build deployment. 
We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our Support team for further review.

We are actively monitoring the situation to ensure stability and will provide an update once the incident has been fully resolved. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Aug 16, 01:30 UTC
Update - Our Engineering team continues work on the rollout with the fix for Python builds failing in App Platform. 
We've identified that a very small number of Apps are impacted by this issue - less than 1% of users have encountered this issue. 
We will post an update once the rollout completes.
Aug 15, 20:27 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has investigated and identified an issue impacting Python builds for App Platform. Beginning approximately 17:30 UTC, users will see the error "Requested runtime 'python-3.11.3' is not available for this stack (heroku-18)". 
The team is in the process of rolling out a fix. 
In the meantime as a workaround, users may update their Apps to use the Ubuntu 22.04-based stack. This stack is in beta, but provides dependency upgrades, and removes support for PHP version 8.0 and earlier. To update, users will need to specify the new stack in the app spec by adding: 
"features:
    - buildpack-stack=ubuntu-22"
We will post another update once the fix has completed rolling out.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:

On August 2, 2023 from 9:01 AM PDT to 11:00 AM PDT, customers may have experienced issues with blurry images in Slack, as well as trouble uploading files. A small percentage of customers may have also experienced errors or slowness when loading channels, sending messages, accessing admin pages, and connecting to Slack.


An issue with a routine database cluster migration inadvertently caused a decrease in capacity. Unfortunately, this coincided with a scheduled job to process a large number of custom status requests, an activity that commonly occurs at the top of each hour. The number of incoming requests exceeded the unintentionally reduced capacity of the database cluster, leading to errors and sluggishness for some actions in Slack. As these requests piled up, other Slack services began to experience issues as well, including a small number of users being unable to connect.


We paused the scheduled custom status job to immediately mitigate the load on the affected database cluster. This resolved some of the errors affecting Slack services. Once we established we had sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled job, we resumed processing the custom status requests, fully restoring normal service for all affected users.


Once the load was balanced and custom status processing had returned to normal, we deployed a fix to correct the issue with the database cluster migration, bringing capacity back to the expected level.]]></summary>

From July 26th, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT to July 28th 2023 at 1:00PM PDT some users had trouble loading and editing canvases when accessing them from the channel canvas icon.


We determined this issue was caused by a recent code change related to how canvases persist across sessions. We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users. To see the fix applied, user impacted users should press Command/Control + R. We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.]]></summary>

On July 27, 2023 between 2:03 AM PDT - 2:59 AM PDT, Slack was experiencing a systemwide issue during which users were not able to send or receive messages across multiple platforms. 


Our engineering team identified an issue after a change was made to a service that manages our internal system communication. This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. 


We are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future. More information about remediation and prevention steps will be included in an upcoming RCA which you can request by writing into feedback@slack.com.]]></summary>
