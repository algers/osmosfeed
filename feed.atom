        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oct 21, 16:03 PDT
Resolved - We have identified an issue with creating room amenity photos. The issue would cause POST requests to fail with either a 404 error or a 500 error. This issue approximately started from last Friday, October 14th, 2022. The photo creations are successful in most cases but the requests fail at a later stage resulting in error responses.
We have fixed this issue at 3:30pm PT today, but there can be duplicate photos created for room amenities during this time. We advise you to review room amenity photos and use the DELETE endpoint to remove duplicate photos.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.]]></summary>
