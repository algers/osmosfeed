From July 26th, 2023 at 8:00AM PDT to July 28th 2023 at 1:00PM PDT some users had trouble loading and editing canvases when accessing them from the channel canvas icon.


We determined this issue was caused by a recent code change related to how canvases persist across sessions. We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users. To see the fix applied, user impacted users should press Command/Control + R. We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.]]></summary>

On July 27, 2023 between 2:03 AM PDT - 2:59 AM PDT, Slack was experiencing a systemwide issue during which users were not able to send or receive messages across multiple platforms. 


Our engineering team identified an issue after a change was made to a service that manages our internal system communication. This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. 


We are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future. More information about remediation and prevention steps will be included in an upcoming RCA which you can request by writing into feedback@slack.com.]]></summary>

Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-27 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-27 05:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavour to keep any such impact to a minimum.

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 day, 20 hours, 25 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Affected Services and Features:</strong></p>
<p>Google Classroom</p>
<p><strong>Regions/Zones:</strong> Global</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Google Classroom experienced an issue where the Classroom iOS app crashed for users when they attempted to access any course page following an update of the app. From preliminary analysis, the root cause was an issue that caused a migration of the app&#39;s local database to fail, resulting in crashes for all users upgrading the application.</p>
<p>Our engineers withdrew the problematic app update and released a new app update with the fix.
Affected users should update their apps to the latest version available on the iOS app store for the fix.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Less than two percent of Daily Active Users for Classroom iOS  experienced app crashes when they attempted to access any course page following an update of the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users that freshly installed the Classroom iOS app were not impacted by the issue.</p>

We would like to inform you that we will deploy a nice improvement to your websites.
Starting today, all Smily websites will be under SSL certificates.
There is nothing you have to do on your side, this change will be automatic and shall not impact your website’s accessibility.
What does it mean ?
Your website’s URL will be starting with https:// and no longer http://.
What are the benefits of this change ?
Websites are more secured
Better user experience
Users stay longer and buy more on secured websites
Sites with HTTPS load faster
HTTPS leads to accurate SEO reporting
Better SEO : SSL is a positive ranking factor for Google. Google’s team has expressed the need for HTTPS time and time again. So much so that they’ve released an algorithm update based on it—causing sites without HTTPS security to struggle on their quest to rank highly in the search engines results.

Hello, 
During the above window, our Engineering team will be performing maintenance on redundant upstream electrical systems in order to improve reliability in our FRA1 region.
Expected Impact:
We don't expect to see any downtime as the power to hypervisors are redundant. In a highly unlikely situation, where we lose power to both the supplies, the Droplets in FRA1 may experience downtime for a brief period. We will endeavor to keep this to a minimum for the duration of the change.

On Wednesday June 28th, 2023 from 10:35 AM PDT to 1:55 PM PDT, some customers experienced delays in loading threads. This was caused by a strain on our databases due to some unusually data-heavy tasks running in the background.

On June 29, 2023 between 12:12 PM PDT and 1:47 PM PDT some users had trouble loading api.slack.com and API documentation was unavailable. This issue was caused due to a code change that resulted in api.slack.com to be broken for users that were not logged in. We quickly reverted the change — resolving the issue for all impacted users.]]></summary>

From 09:27 PDT on Friday June 23th 2023 to 14:23 PDT the same day, some customers experienced delays in loading messages and conversations. This was caused by a slight strain on our databases due to some unusually data heavy tasks running in the background.


We stopped the tasks that caused that strain, which resolved the problem for impacted users.

On June 30, 2023 from 8:12 AM PDT to 4:23 PM PDT, some users may have had trouble signing in to Slack with magic login codes or via the 'Sign In With Email' button. 


A code change inadvertently introduced a logic error in the sign-in flow. We identified the error and deployed an initial fix to correct the flawed logic. This resolved the problem with the 'Sign In With Email' button. After further investigation, we deployed a second correction to address the trouble with magic login codes, resolving the issue for all affected customers.


We believed the first fix had resolved the problem for all customers, and we updated the status site accordingly. However, we discovered that the issue with magic login codes had not been addressed, and we posted a separate notice on the status site while we investigated further. We apologize for any confusion and for calling the all clear too quickly. 


We have updated the titles for both entries so that they match.]]></summary>
