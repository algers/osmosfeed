Update - All payments with a check date of March 10th have been successfully submitted. Some have been completed, and others will complete between Saturday, March 11th and Monday, March 13th.
This morning, Rippling was assured by SVB that all payments would be processed today. However, when SVB fell into receivership with the FDIC, we immediately began working with JPMorgan Chase to find an alternative means to send funds to employees. 
As a result of the actions we took, all employees will receive their payments between today and Monday morning, depending on which bank they use. Rippling has extended our own capital to fund these payments while client funds are locked up with SVB.
When will employees with a March 10, 2023 check date be paid?

On March 9, 2023 from 8:28 PM to March 10, 2023 8:40 AM PST, some users that were signed into multiple workspaces experienced a redirect issue when signing into the Google Drive app from Slack.

We discovered the service degradation was prompted by a load test that ran at a higher rate than intended, causing database outages to occur. To remediate the issue, we scaled back the load test to the normal rate which resolved the problem for all impacted users.]]></summary>

We will be doing some improvements on our website infrastructure which may temporarily affect your websites.
The maintenance will take place on tuesday March 14, 2023 at 06:00am CET and will have a duration of 3 hours max.
What will be the impact?
· Websites may not be unreachable for up to 10 minutes at maintenance time.
· SSL may be unavailable from the beginning of the maintenance for up to 3 hours (website will still be reachable without https)
Do I need to do anything?
This maintenance will impact the DNS zone we are using to link your website to our infrastructure, therefore some changes will be required in the 2 weeks following this update if you are using your own domain name with A records.
We will send a second communication with the information and update our manual to help you with this transition.
Of course our support team will be there to assist you.
Thank you for your comprehension,]]></summary>

On March 7, 2023 from 9:15 AM to 6:31 PM PST, some users may have experienced slow search response times or failed searches.


We made a routine adjustment to our infrastructure that inadvertently increased load and decreased response rates for our search servers. New messages sent during this period were not indexed immediately and would not have been searchable.


We restarted the affected server nodes, returning search performance to normal and allowing the system to catch up on the backlogged indexing tasks. Once the system handled the backlog and we confirmed that indexing was complete, full search functionality was restored to all customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:


On Tuesday February 14th, 2023 from 1:19 AM PST to 3:50 AM PST some customers reported an issue where the API method files.upload created a new message instead of uploading files in a thread.


Our team identified that the cause of the issue was linked to a recent update. This change was rolled back which fixed the issue. 


Note: This summary has been edited since its initial posting to better align with Slack's communication guidelines.]]></summary>

On Monday February 13th, 2023 at 07:00PM to Tuesday February 14th, 2023 at 01:02 AM PST, customers were unable to view threads in public channels they had not joined. This was caused by a recent code change - we've deployed a correction to this and the issue is now resolved.


Should customers continue to experience this behaviour, a hard refresh of the Slack client will fix this.]]></summary>

Resolved - Engineering has implemented mitigations, which should have resolved performance issues. We’ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we run into issues again.
We found that page analytics events, such as page views and page edits, did not save during the time of this incident. Impacted users may see their page related analytics as undercounted for February 13, 2023. Our team is looking into how we can prevent this from happening in the future. We appreciate your patience while we work on making these improvements.

Investigating - Notion users may experience general performance slowness. Engineering is currently investigating and implementing mitigations.]]></summary>
