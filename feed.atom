Monitoring - We are currently addressing a bug that affects the bedroom, bathroom, and bed count on our Listings API. Due to a change in behavior of how bedrooms, bathrooms and beds interact with the Listing Rooms API, you might come across the following issues:
* On the Listings API, some listings might have the fields `bedrooms`,`bathrooms` and/or `beds` set to 0.
* On the Listings Rooms API, some rooms might have been created/deleted.
As of today, we have reverted the problematic behavior and are working diligently to restore the correct bedrooms, bathrooms, and beds values on the Listings API. To ensure that your Listing Rooms are accurately set, we kindly ask you to re-sync your data.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>From Friday, 2 June 2023 to Saturday, 3 June 2023, some Google Workspace Administrators experienced issues performing List, Create, Update, or Delete operations for users and organizational units (OU) when using the Admin Console or Directory APIs. The total outage duration was 16 hours and 32 minutes. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>The Google Workspace Admin Console and Directory APIs use a backend service to authorize requests to create/update/delete/read user and OU resources. A workflow synchronizes user and OU resources to that backend authorization service.</p>
<p>On Friday, 2 June 2023 at 12:25 PDT, engineers rolled out a configuration change that inadvertently caused the workflow to stop synchronizing resources to the authorization service. Because the authorization service was not aware of the new resources (those created during the outage), it was unable to authorize requests and returned a 403 Unauthorized error. The incorrect configuration went undetected before being deployed to production because the automatic pre-submit checks had been suppressed because engineers incorrectly believed the change was safe.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case on 2 June 2023 at 19:33 PDT and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified that the roll out of the configuration change aligned with the start of 403 Unauthorized errors and initiated a rollback on 3 June 2023 at 00:14 PDT. The rollback completed at 00:57 PDT, mitigating the issue for new users and OU resources created after that time. Engineers performed a backfill to synchronize the impacted users and OU resources that were created after the start of the issue, fully mitigating the issue at 04:57 PDT.</p>
<p>Google is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be updating the pre-submit checks for workflow configuration changes to better identify potential issues before rolling out to production.</li>
<li>We will be adding a requirement to have a designated reviewer approve workflow configuration changes to ensure that automated presubmit checks are being run before rolling out to production.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>
<p>From 2 June 2023 at 12:25 PDT to 3 June 2023 at 04:57, Google Workspace Administrators may have experienced 403 Unauthorized errors when attempting to perform actions for user and OU resources via Admin Console or Directory APIs. This issue affected Create, Fetch, Update, Delete and other related operations for user and OU resources created between 2 June 2023 at 12:25 PDT and 3 June 2023 at 00:57 PDT.</p>

Identified - We're currently experiencing an issue that appears only in certain unique circumstances when a running scenario is not properly using the values of team or organization variables during executions.
Specific circumstances for the issue are:
- A team or organization variable is used as a filter condition OR there is more than one team or organization variable referenced within a single mapped field, OR the variable is used inside a function.
- AND the scenario was created / modified before March 8, 2023 
- AND the execution occurs after May 3, 2023
Workaround: 
Any user encountering this issue can open the affected scenario, make any change (move a module) and hit save. This will immediately resolve the issue for that scenario.
Complete resolution: 
The development team is actively working on a fix that will address any scenario where the issue still persists. Will post an update once we have more information around the permanent fix.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jun  1, 01:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
May 31, 23:11 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-06-01 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-06-01 05:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO2 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

From May 30th, 2023 at 8:02 AM PDT until 11:18 AM PDT, some users experienced unexpected behavior with autocomplete suggestions, including incorrect rankings & incomplete results when conducting searches.


We traced the source of the issue back to an error that occurred in our autocomplete cache. A fix was rolled out to our search logic which began to show the correct results.

From May 30th, 2023 at around 8:00 PM PDT until May 31st, 2023 at 9:20 AM PDT, users with the Reacji Channeler app installed in their workspace experienced some issues where the app would not execute.


The issue was traced back to a recent change that occurred for one of our app databases. This caused the app to accept new requests even though it was unable to connect to the database, resulting in timeout errors. 


We reverted the change and restarted the backend processes which allowed the app to connect to the database again, resolving the issue for impacted users. We apologize for any disruptions to your day.]]></summary>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the full resolution of the issue impacting Spaces performance and availability in our NYC3 region.
From 00:20 to 00:57 UTC, users may have experienced slowness or timeouts when trying to access or manage their Spaces resources in NYC3, static site assets in NYC, or App Platform bandwidth insights.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has continued to actively monitor the situation resulting from multiple subsea fiber faults in the APAC region. Over the last few days, our team has continued to make routing changes where possible. 
Crews have been able to complete some cable repairs and we expect to see our network routing stabilize once the repair of a few more cables are completed in the coming weeks. Until then, we expect to see intermittent periods of packet loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and New York City, as well as Singapore and Toronto. These are normally short-lived and happen during Singapore business hours when traffic is heavy. 
Given the relative stability of routes, we will now close out this incident and provide any needed updates sepa…]]></summary>
