From 6:00 PM PST on September 3, 2023 to 12:40 PM PST on September 5, 2023, some users could not launch their Slack desktop apps.


We determined that a code change caused the app to call deleted workspaces for users, resulting in an error and an app loading loop.


Once the root cause was identified, we immediately made an adjustment to the code so that it did not call deleted teams for users, which resulted in the app loading properly once more.]]></summary>

From 12:24 PM PDT on August 30, 2023 to 12:44 PM PDT on September 5, 2023, some users were unable to switch channels using Slack in the browser.


We determined that the clicking on a channel in the sidebar ended up in a codepath which was requesting focus of the main Slack window. So in any case where the Slack app was opened from another page, the users encountered an issue.


The code change was reverted and a fix was deployed which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 hours, 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Affected Services and Features:</strong></p>
<p>ChromeOS</p>
<p><strong>Regions/Zones:</strong> Global</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>ChromseOS experienced an issue where some users were unable to log in for a duration of 3 hours and 10 minutes. From preliminary root cause investigation, the issue was caused by an unexpected traffic surge due to a combination of a feature roll out and back to school traffic. The unexpected surge led to compute resource exhaustion on device management servers, which in turn caused the log in requests to fail. Google will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Impact:</strong>
Some users of ChromeOS devices experienced log in issues.</p>

Resolved - Between 06:59 UTC to 13:18 UTC GitHub customers experienced intermittent increased latency when using our git archive and raw file downloading capability. This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.
During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data.

On August 28, 2023 from 4:30 AM PDT to 10:30 AM PDT, less than 1% of Slack users encountered slowness when loading channels, DMs, and threads. Some impacted users were also unable to load the sidebar.


We found that a host that caches workspace member, channel, and integration data was impacted by timeout errors. This prevented users on some workspaces from routing to the host and, in turn, reaching their cached data. 


We restarted the affected host, cleared the associated cache for impacted workspaces, and asked affected users to reload their Slack apps. This combination of steps resolved the issue for all users. 


We're continuing to investigate what caused the timeout errors to prevent future reoccurrence.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: An issue in the Tailscale client, combined with a behavior
of the UPnP implementations in some routers, could expose all UDP ports of a
node to external networks (usually the internet).
As of 2023-08-22 2:30 AM UTC, we have changed the Tailscale coordination server
to advise nodes to stop using UPnP for port mapping. In some cases this can
degrade NAT traversal and may cause some connections to route through DERP.
This may increase node-to-node latency and decrease throughput. Version 1.48.1
resolves the issue and re-enables port mapping via UPnP.
What happened?
Tailscale nodes use UPnP as one of the mechanisms to open UDP port forwarding
in routers to help with NAT traversal. Tailscale picks a node port and an
external router port and requests forwarding between them. On firs…]]></summary>

Identified - Our Engineering team identified an issue with VPC Connectivity for resources in our NYC3 region. 
Users creating new resources were not able to place them correctly into VPC's in NYC3 via API create requests. Users also saw network connectivity errors between members of NYC3 VPC's. This issue impacted Droplet-based products like Load Balances and Managed Kubernetes clusters as well, manifesting in various VPC-related errors.
Our team was able to mitigate this issue and we're currently monitoring the situation. As of 00:00 UTC, users should see normal VPC behavior in NYC3.

Identified - Our Engineering team has investigated and identified an issue impacting Python builds for App Platform. Beginning approximately 17:30 UTC, users will see the error "Requested runtime 'python-3.11.3' is not available for this stack (heroku-18)". 
The team is in the process of rolling out a fix. 
In the meantime as a workaround, users may update their Apps to use the Ubuntu 22.04-based stack. This stack is in beta, but provides dependency upgrades, and removes support for PHP version 8.0 and earlier. To update, users will need to specify the new stack in the app spec by adding: 
"features:
    - buildpack-stack=ubuntu-22"
We will post another update once the fix has completed rolling out.]]></summary>

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Aug  9, 20:01 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug  6, 14:36 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-09 20:00 UTC
End:  2023-08-10 00:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SGP1 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase.
Expected impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket]]></summary>
