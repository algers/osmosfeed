On November 8, 2023 from 7:55 AM PT until 8:27 PM PT, a small number of users experienced errors when attempting to join or start huddles.


We traced this back to an unexpected spike in a database load for which we quickly saw recovery.


We monitored the situation closely and in an effort to prevent further unexpected error spikes, we implemented a strategic configuration adjustment to optimize the load on our database.


Affected users should no longer experience issues with huddles.]]></summary>

Resolved - On 2023-11-15, from 09:44 to 10:42 UTC, some GitHub customers experienced increased latency or errors accessing repo data.
High concurrent access to a specific git object exposed a bug that forced a backend service to perform excessive calculations, overloading the service. Access to this repo was paused while load was re-rerouted, mitigating the problem.
The conditions that triggered the expensive operations have been identified and refactored.
Nov 15, 11:33 UTC
Update - Error rates and performance have returned to normal.
Nov 15, 11:21 UTC
Update - We have identified the source of the issue and have removed the additional load from the service. Sporadic delays in pull request experiences and intermittent 500s are still occurring and impacting a very small percentage of traffic. Next update is expected within 30 minutes.
Nov 15, 11:04 UTC
Update - We are seeing connectivity issues between some of our systems and git backend services. This is causing intermittent error responses and delays in pull request experiences for a very small percentage of traffic. We are investigating mitigations and expect to provide another update within 30 minutes.

Nov  3, 19:43 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. Upstream congestion with a network provider between Los Angeles and Dallas is impacting traffic traversing out of our SFO datacentres.
A case has been opened by our team with the provider. Our team has attempted to shift traffic to improve the situation, but unfortunately, we continue to see approximately 10% of customer traffic impacted by this issue.
Our team is working on an option to shift to an alternate provider if this issue is not able to be resolved by the provider in a timely manner. We will share another update once we have further information from the provider or we have an update from our Engineering team.
Nov  3, 19:27 UTC
Investigating - As of 17:40 UTC, our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting networking in the SFO regions.

These classifications are false positives, and we are working with Microsoft to
resolve the situation.
As of 2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC, we have confirmed that Microsoft have addressed
the false positive, meaning Defender no longer flags Tailscale 1.46.1 as
malware. A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.
What happened?
Microsoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware. This caused
Defender to quarantine the binaries, meaning they could not run.
We submitted Tailscale 1.46.1 to Microsoft to investigate the false positive,
who then updated Defender to avoid flagging this release as malware at
2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC.
Who is affected?
People using Defender and Tailscale 1.46.1.
What is the impact?
Tailscale will not run on affected machines.
What do I need to do?
To resolve this issue on your own tailnet, you can take either or both of 2
approaches:
Update to a newer version of Tailscale. Newer versions are not affected by this problem.
Create an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.
Update Microsoft Defender.]]></summary>

Resolved - Copilot completions are currently hosted in 4 regions globally: Central US, France, Switzerland and Japan. Users are typically routed to the nearest geographic region, but may be routed to other regions when the nearest region is unhealthy.
Beginning at 2023-10-25 09:13 UTC, Copilot began experiencing outages of individual regions, lasting 12 minutes per region. These outages were due to the nodes hosting the completion model getting unhealthy due to a recent upgrade. There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors. The outages were partial and varied across the different regions.
In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we are focusing on improving our global load balancing of completion traffic during regional failures, in addition to determining and preventing the root cause of these outages.

Resolved - Copilot completions are currently hosted in 4 regions globally: Central US, France, Switzerland and Japan. Users are typically routed to the nearest geographic region, but may be routed to other regions when the nearest region is unhealthy.
Beginning at 2023-10-25 09:13 UTC, Copilot began experiencing outages of individual regions, lasting 12 minutes per region. These outages were due to the nodes hosting the completion model getting unhealthy due to a recent upgrade. There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors. The outages were partial and varied across the different regions.
In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we are focusing on improving our global load balancing of completion traffic during regional failures, in addition to determining and preventing the root cause of these outages.
Oct 25, 12:56 UTC
Update - We have applied a fix to help with Copilot performance. Initial signals show good recovery. We will continue to monitor for the time being and resolve when confident the issue has been resolved.
Oct 25, 12:29 UTC
Update - We are investigating degraded performance in Europe for Copilot. We will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.
Oct 25, 12:10 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Copilot]]></summary>

In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Oct 20, 19:40 UTC
Update - After a thorough review by the team performing this maintenance, we have determined that our initial messaging does not convey the complete scope and potential impact of this event. Existing infrastructure will continue running without issue during this maintenance window. However, users may experience increased latency with some platform operations, including: 
Cloud Control Panel and API operations
Event processing
Droplet creates, resizes, rebuilds, and power events
Managed Kubernetes reconciliation and scaling
Load Balancer operations
Container Registry operations

Resolved - This incident has been resolved.
From 11:21 to 16:07 UTC some GitHub customers experienced errors cloning via workflows or via the command line.
A third-party configuration change resulted in an unexpected behavior to our systems that resulted in Git clone failures. Once we detected the change we were able to disable it, and our systems started operating normally.
With the incident mitigated, we are working with our third-party provider to improve subsequent configuration change rollouts.
Oct 22, 15:58 UTC
Update - We have mitigated the cause of the issue and are awaiting positive confirmation from impacted customers that the issue is fully resolved.
Oct 22, 15:34 UTC
Update - We are currently investigating reports from some customers encountering errors when cloning repositories via workflows or via the command line. We do not currently have an ETA for resolution. Next update in 30 minutes.
Oct 22, 15:16 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Git Operations]]></summary>
