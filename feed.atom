It will take a little while for the fix to address each affected reminder, but we expect that your reminders will be restored by the next scheduled reminder occurrence. 


If you'd prefer to fetch the fix immediately, you can delete the affected reminders and set them up again. Please follow these steps to delete an existing reminder: 


1. Open the channel where the reminder was set up.

2. Use the "/remind list" slash command. 

3. Find your reminder in the list that appears and click "Delete". 

4. Set your reminder up again.


Thank you for your patience while we worked to resolve this. If you have any further trouble, please let us know at feedback@slack.com.]]></summary>

The issue caused standard fee PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE to be cleared and as a result some reservations might be missing the cleaning fee. 
Please reapply the Standard Fees by making PUT pricing_settings requests with the desired fees.
This should re-populate the listings' Standard Fees array as intended, namely the PASS_THROUGH_CLEANING_FEE.

Update - Our Engineering team detected large amounts of loss and latency on network routes between Singapore and Frankfurt, from 13:10 - 13:20 UTC, today. The issue self-recovered, likely due to upstream providers shuffling traffic. 
Additionally, our team is seeing high levels of loss and latency on network routes between Bangalore and Sydney. Users may see packet loss or notice less performant services at this time. The Network Engineering team is currently exploring options to route around the issue or any other steps that can be taken to mitigate impact to users.
May 14, 03:31 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has not observed higher-than-normal periods of packet loss and latency over the last 12 hours and user reports of degraded performance have returned to pre-incident levels. 
Until the cable cuts in the APAC region are completely resolved, we expect there to be intermittent periods of degraded performance, especially during APAC business hours. 
We'll continue to monitor the situation through the next few days and provide any needed updates. If you experience any issues, feel free to open a support ticket and our team will be happy to assist.
May 12, 16:52 UTC
Identified - Due to the ongoing subsea fiber faults in the APAC region, our Engineering team is observing a recurrence of packet loss and increased latency between Singapore and Europe/North American regions, during peak hours in Asia. 
We've received reports of users experiencing degraded performance for Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as with pushes to Container Registry, and deployments of App Platform apps. 
Our team is actively engaged in attempting to re-route traffic where possible to improve performance. Until the cable cuts are fully resolved, users may continue to experience intermittent periods of degraded service.

<p><strong>Regions/Zones:</strong> Multi Region Europe</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Multiple Google services, including GCP and Workspace, experienced an outage for a duration of up to 56 minutes in and around Spain/Morocco. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a Google initiated network routing change at the edge of our network there. The issue was mitigated at 12:58 by removing the problematic routers from service, forcing traffic to use other paths.</p>

Resolved: May 09, 2023 - 03:42 UTC

Our Engineering team identified an issue with the path that resolver traffic was taking for our SFO1 region, resulting in services in SFO1 being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. A fix has been put in place and we've confirmed that DNS resolution is now functioning normally.
We're now monitoring the situation and will post an update shortly once we confirm full resolution of this incident.
Monitoring: May 09, 2023 - 02:49 UTC

Our Engineering team is investigating user reports of services in our SFO1 region being unable to complete DNS lookups/resolve domains. This includes running commands on Droplets that utilize DNS lookups, such as "wget" and "apt update", etc. Inbound network connections to services should still be operating normally. 
Thank you for your patience as our team works to understand the root cause of the issue. We'll post an update once we have further information.

During the above window, we will be performing maintenance on core network equipment in our TOR1 datacenter as part of network upgrade.
Expected impact:
This maintenance is designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic during the maintenance period. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services would experience a temporary loss of connectivity over the public network. Services in the TOR1 region could also experience issues with management of events such as power on/off, snapshots, and backups etc. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions related to this issue please send us a ticket from your cloud support page. https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server in device
reauthentication logic caused previously authenticated and tagged devices to
lose their ACL tags upon reauthentication.
What happened?
The logic that handles the reauthentication to a new identity on an
already-authenticated device with tags had a bug: instead of updating the
device’s logged-in identity to the newly authenticated user, the device’s
identity became that of the user who originally added it to the tailnet, without
any tags.
The bug was introduced on 2022-10-26, and discovered and remediated on
2023-04-21. The bug was discovered when troubleshooting a user-reported issue.
Who is affected?
189 tailnets triggered this bug in the course of normal use of Tailscale, either
directly by explicitly re-authenticating a device, or indirectly by using fast
user switching to switch between multiple
tailnets.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security
contacts.
What is the impact?
Devices that encountered the bug had their tags removed, which reverted the
device’s identity to that of the user who originally authenticated the device,
or the owner of the auth key that was originally used to authenticate the
device. In either case, this is the user listed as “Creator” in the Machines tab
of the admin panel. Depending on access rules in the tailnet policy file, this
could change the device’s network permissions.
We have analyzed the audit logs for affected tailnets, and found no evidence of
deliberate exploitation. In most instances, device owners noticed the incorrect
outcome of reauthentication, and corrected the device’s state themselves.
What do I need to do?
If you were not contacted by Tailscale, no action is required.  If you were
contacted by Tailscale, reapply the desired tags to affected devices in the
admin console, or by reauthenticating the devices. Tailscale has deployed a fix
to the coordination server as of 2023-04-21, and notified affected
organizations.]]></summary>
