Starting around 12:46 PM PST on February 6, 2024, until around 4:06 PM PST on February 9, 2024, some users experienced issues with their profile pictures loading, resulting in the default avatar image displaying instead of their custom image.


We identified a bug that caused missing image data from a database cache. We fixed the bug and reset the backend cache to pull new data, which initially fixed the issue around 4:00 PM PST on February 6. However, some users began experiencing the problem again once their Slack client refreshed.


We continued investigating the issue, tracing it back to a piece of code that would push older image data to a database that housed profile information, and promptly reverted the incorrect code which resolved the issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
We are thrilled to share with you some great news :)
We are now supporting and managing Booking.com Sponsored Benefit program at Smily;
Benefits for you:
You were facing the obstacle where booking.com **was paying a small amount of the booking.com reservation due to a discount offered to the guest.
1/ it was not blocking the synchronisation of your listing but was creating an issue for the payment;
2/ you had to send manually a payment link to collect the remaining amount to the guests. This won’t be necessary anymore!


Now, as we do support the Sponsored benefit program, you will still see and receive this small amount in advance paid by Booking.com and we will process with success the rest of the payment!


You can now join this program if you were waiting for this functionality 🙂
How does this program benefit your business?
When applied, it offers the following advantages for your business:
Boosts bookings from price-conscious customers
Lowers cancellations with customers paying in advance
Increases your revenue by covering the reduced amount to drive more bookings
Take the next step:
Take a look at what this program is about and check out if you are eligible to enable it and enjoy it;
Check our new manual
Your business deserves the best, and with Smily’s latest feature, we’re here to ensure you get just that.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
The Airbnb Listing expectation type feature is now available on Smily. 
This update lets you enrich your listings with additional information, directly from Smily's user-friendly interface.
Pain Points Addressed:
Gone are the days of toggling between platforms. Previously, you had to navigate Airbnb's website to update listing details, a time-consuming and inefficient process. Smily's new feature streamlines this, offering a seamless integration within the interface.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Easily accessible under the "amenities" section in the Smily interface, the new "Property Info" category empowers you to select and customize expectation types, with an optional description of up to 100 characters.
This information is then flawlessly synced with Airbnb for those using full synchronization, ensuring a cohesive and accurate listing.
It will also be synchronised on your website if you have one with Smily!
Such information is key and valuable for the guests to avoid any negative surprises on check-in day!
→ Here is where to find this new section on the Smily interface👇
-> Then click on the pen to edit/add an optional description;

ℹ️ Next steps and important information
For those using this via Airbnb, we've already fetched your existing listing expectations from Airbnb as of February 9th.


To ensure data alignment with this new feature, please update any changes made since then before our official release on February 21st via the Smily interface;
→ On February 21st, we will start the synchronisation of your data from Smily to the Airbnb application. Any values not reflected on the Smily interface will be removed from Airbnb.


Please note, that the Smily interface allows a description limit of 100 characters compared to Airbnb's 300. Should this affect your listings, we'll reach out individually.
→ if you cannot update your description before February 21st, let us know please;


Have a great day,
Your Smily team :)]]></summary>

On February 12, 2024 from 6:00 AM PST to 8:32 AM PST, some users experienced latency when loading canvases or errors related to editing and saving canvases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feb 12, 18:14 UTC
Resolved - On Monday February 12th, 2024, 03:00 UTC we deployed a code change to a component of Copilot. At 06:00 UTC we observed an increase in timeouts for code completions impacting 55% of Copilot users at peak across Asia and Europe.

Resolved - On February 9, 2024 between 10:34 UTC and 11:24 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded and 63% of webhooks were delayed by up to 16 minutes with an average delay of 5 minutes. No webhook deliveries were lost. This was due to an issue with an overloaded backend data store that was unable to process network requests fast enough.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over traffic to healthy hosts.
We are expanding the capacity of the backing store as well as making the Webhooks service more resilient to this kind of issue. 

Feb  9, 11:25 UTC
Update - Webhooks is operating normally.
Feb  9, 11:11 UTC
Update - We are investigating latency in processing webhooks. Customers may see a delay of around 5 minutes at this time. We will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Feb  6, 17:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Feb  2, 20:23 UTC
Scheduled - Start Time: 17:00 UTC Feb 6, 2024
End Time: 00:00 UTC Feb 7, 2024
During the above time, our Engineering Team will be performing maintenance to failover some internal databases from one cluster to another.
Extensive testing has been conducted to ensure this maintenance will be successful and result in minimal impact to DigitalOcean users. The actual failover is estimated to take less than 3 seconds.
Existing infrastructure, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, should continue running without issue. There is no network disruption to existing services expected as part of this maintenance. However, there are dependencies on multiple services. During the failover, there may be customer impacts that should be brief and transitory. The following actions may experience increased latency or failure rates during the maintenance period:
- API calls to the DigitalOcean public API 
- Events for Droplets and Droplet-based services such as create, delete, power on/off, resize, etc 
- Control operations through the DigitalOcean Cloud Control Panel 
Multiple teams will be engaged to keep downtime to a minimum and mitigate any impact that does occur. We’ll post updates here for any unexpected changes to this scheduled maintenance, as well as progress updates during the maintenance itself.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Support team from within your account.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jan 31, 14:57 UTC
Resolved - This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.
The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.
For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.
We have so far identified three remediation items here:
- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.
- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.
- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.
Jan 31, 14:56 UTC
Update - We have resolved the issue and confirmed all regions are now operating as expected.
Jan 31, 14:49 UTC
Update - The fix for ip allow lists is currently rolling out; and we are awaiting confirmation from specific geographic regions.
Jan 31, 14:33 UTC
Update - We are rolling out a fix to resolve the issues with IP allow lists. This should be resolved shortly.
Jan 31, 14:14 UTC
Update - Some customers are experiencing issues with IP allow lists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: We resolved an information disclosure vulnerability in the
hello.ts.net service.
What happened?
On January 15 2024, we became aware of a potential information disclosure
vulnerability in the hello.ts.net service, which could show the identity of a
different Tailscale user when loaded. The hello.ts.net service receives
identity information and public keys of nodes tied to their IP address. On
November 28 2023, we made a change to how IPs are assigned to
Tailscale nodes, making them globally non-unique. When the Tailscale service
assigned the same IP to multiple nodes, hello.ts.net would receive identity
information for one of the nodes at random. We confirmed on January 26 2024
that, if one of the other nodes with that IP loaded hello.ts.net, they would
see another user's name, email, and hostname.
The Tailscale Security Team immediately took hello.ts.net offline while the
fix was in progress. The issue has been fixed and the hello.ts.net service
was restored on January 29 2024.
Who was affected?
The incident was isolated to 10 users across 9 tailnets who could have had
their information leaked to other Tailscale users. We notified the tailnet
security contacts directly in accordance with our obligations under applicable
data privacy laws. Due to the random nature of the vulnerability, we cannot
confirm that all of those users were indeed affected.
Regular shared nodes always see unique node IPs and were not
vulnerable in a manner similar to hello.ts.net.
What was the impact?
A small number of users had their name, email, and hostname potentially exposed
to other Tailscale users that had nodes sharing the same IP.
In addition, the hello.ts.net service was offline between January 26-29
2024. Several users reported being negatively impacted by this.
What do I need to do?
No action is needed at this time.
If you have a dependency on hello.ts.net as a probing target for Tailscale
connectivity, consider using a different probing
mechanism.]]></summary>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the workaround fix is successful and all services should now be operating normally. We will now close this incident and work with the DNS provider separately on the root cause. 
We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team for further review.
Jan 29, 18:18 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue with DNS resolution. DigitalOcean resolvers in use in FRA1, AMS3, and LON1 are unable to reach an upstream DNS provider, resulting in resolution for a subset of domain names being unavailable from our resolvers. Our Engineering team is reaching out to the provider for assistance.
In the meantime, our Engineering team has been able to implement a workaround fix by filtering some incorrectly announced network routes. At this time, we are seeing recovery and resolution of hostnames returning to normal in the impacted regions. We'll continue to await an update from the DNS provider. We're now monitoring the workaround fix for stability and will post an update once we are confident it is successful.
Jan 29, 17:27 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is currently investigating issues with DNS resolution in FRA1, AMS3, and LON1. During this time, customers may experience errors trying to resolve domain names from within DigitalOcean services in those regions, including Droplets and Droplet-based services, as well as App Platform. Additionally, App Platform builds may fail or experience delays.

Resolved - On January 28, 2024, between 01:00 UTC and 14:00 UTC the Avatars service was degraded and could not return all avatar images requested by users, instead it would return a default, fallback avatar image. This incident impacted, at peak time 6% of the requests for viewing Avatars. Requests that were impacted did not prevent the users from continuing to use any GitHub services. This was due to an issue with the Avatars service connecting to a database host.
 We mitigated the incident by restarting the malfunctioning hosts that were not able to return the user avatar images.
 We are working to improve alerting and monitoring of our services to reduce our time to detection and mitigation.
Jan 28, 14:27 UTC
Update - We have mitigated all customer impact. We are no longer serving fallback avatar icons when loading web pages for some customers. We continue to monitor the results.

From 12:20pm PST until 3:00pm PST on January 22, 2024, some Enterprise Grid users noticed multiple Slackbot responses being triggered unexpectedly.


We determined that the rollout of a fix for an older bug report pertaining to Slackbot responses not working in org-wide or multi-workspace channels, was the root cause. 


Whilst the fix for the bug was intended to improve this features behaviour, ensuring that Slackbot custom responses would work in these channel types, our wider team concluded that the fixed behaviour might not function well for organizations with potentially thousands of custom Slackbot responses.


We rolled back the deployment which caused this behaviour. Customers will no longer see these Slackbot custom responses being triggered unexpectedly.


A discussion is underway about the long-term future of Slackbot custom response behaviour within large organizations.

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 at 3:38 UTC, we experienced an incident that affected customers using Codespaces. Customers encountered issues creating and resuming Codespaces in multiple regions due to operational issues with compute and storage resources.
Around 25% of customers were impacted, primarily in East US and West Europe. We re-routed traffic for Codespace creations to less impacted regions, but existing Codespaces in these regions may have been unable to resume during the incident.
By 7:30 UTC, we had recovered connectivity to all regions except West Europe, which had an extended recovery time due to increased load in that particular region. The incident was resolved on 2024-01-21 at 9:34 UTC once Codespace creations and resumes were working normally in all regions.

Resolved - On 2024-01-21 from 02:05 UTC to 06:19 UTC, GitHub Hosted Runners experienced increased error rates from our main cloud service provider. The errors were initially limited to a single region and we were able to route around the issue by transparently failing over to other regions. However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.
During the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.
We’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.
Jan 21, 05:54 UTC
Update - We've applied a mitigation to fix the issues with queuing and running Actions jobs. We are seeing improvements in telemetry and are monitoring for full recovery.
Jan 21, 05:26 UTC
Update - We have mitigated the issues impacting Actions Larger Runners. We are still experiencing delays starting normal jobs, and are continuing to investigate.
Jan 21, 04:53 UTC
Update - The team has identified the cause of the issues with Actions Larger Runners and has begun mitigation.
Jan 21, 04:16 UTC
Update - The team continues to investigate issues with some Actions jobs being queued for a long time and a percentage of jobs failing. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.
Jan 21, 03:45 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Actions]]></summary>
