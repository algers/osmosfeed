<p>We apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues.

<p>(All Times US/Pacific)</p>
<p><strong>Incident Start:</strong> 24 March, 2023 01:10</p>
<p><strong>Incident End:</strong> 24 March, 2023 04:38</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 hours, 28 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Affected Services and Features:</strong></p>
<p>Google Workspace Support  - Chat Support</p>
<p><strong>Regions/Zones:</strong> Global</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Google Workspace Support Chat did not display the option for the customer to select a subset of support languages (whether available or unavailable) globally for a duration of 3 hours and 28 minutes. As a result, the list of available languages changed per-session. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent deployment. The issue was fully mitigated once a rollback completed.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Normally all languages the customer is entitled to use should appear in the list of languages (whether available or not). Workspace support admins would occasionally not see their preferred language listed at all.</p>
<p><strong>Additional details:</strong></p>
<p>As the language list appeared to change on reload, Workspace support admins could re-attempt by refreshing the support chat and would see a different list. This workaround was not confirmed to work.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reference: CVE-2023-28436
Severity: Medium
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH in FreeBSD allowed commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified by Tailscale SSH access rules.
Affected platforms: FreeBSD
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.38.2 or later
What happened?
A difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD setgroups system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.
Who is affected?
9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.
We have notified affected organizations where we have security contacts.
What is the impact?
Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:
The destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;
Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and
A non-interactive SSH session was used.
What do I need to do?
If you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions in the admin console.
To update the local ports tree in advance of what’s available upstream, you can:
cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale
edit the Makefile to set PORTVERSION to 1.38.2
make makesum
make install
Tailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.

We would like to thank Ryan Belgrave for reporting this issue.]]></summary>

As we are doing some improvements on our infrastructure, we have some modifications that are necessary on the way some of your website domains are configured.
To ensure that you have the best configuration, we invite you to review the settings on your registrar to make sure that you have the correct configuration.
What is needed?
Your main domain should be under a **Cname **record with **www **and point to dns1.happystay.com. (the "dot" at the end may be required depending on your domain).
(example for your main domain: www.yourwebsite.com)
You can also add an addon domain without using www if you want your website to be reachable this way, (example: yourwebsite.com).
In order to do that, you can configure an A record (Aname) in your DNS zone pointing to one of the following IP addresses:
13.248.140.34


76.223.14.214


These are the new addresses that are replacing the previous address: (52.210.201.133)
Important note, If you are using 52.210.201.133, you need to change to one of the new IP address as we will not be able to keep supporting this one on March 29th 2023.
If you need assistance doing this change, please contact our support team and we will be happy to assist you with the modifications. Please make sure to have access to your registrar (Gandi, OVH, Godaddy…) so we can assist you in performing this change. 
The details are also available on our manual.
Thanks,]]></summary>

On March 13th, 2023 from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM PDT, some Enterprise Grid customers using the Slack for Intune mobile app may have experienced errors or latency when logging in to Slack.


We identified that this issue was caused by a conflict between Slack functionality and a Slack for Intune preference. We deployed a manual fix, resolving the issue for all impacted users.]]></summary>

This morning, Rippling was assured by SVB that all payments would be processed today. However, when SVB fell into receivership with the FDIC, we immediately began working with JPMorgan Chase to find an alternative means to send funds to employees. 
As a result of the actions we took, all employees will receive their payments between today and Monday morning, depending on which bank they use. Rippling has extended our own capital to fund these pay…]]></summary>

We will be doing some improvements on our website infrastructure which may temporarily affect your websites.
The maintenance will take place on tuesday March 14, 2023 at 06:00am CET and will have a duration of 3 hours max.
What will be the impact?
· Websites may not be unreachable for up to 10 minutes at maintenance time.
· SSL may be unavailable from the beginning of the maintenance for up to 3 hours (website will still be reachable without https)
Do I need to do anything?
This maintenance will impact the DNS zone we are using to link your website to our infrastructure, therefore some changes will be required in the 2 weeks following this update if you are using your own domain name with A records.
We will send a second communication with the information and update our manual to help you with this transition.
Of course our support team will be there to assist you.
Thank you for your comprehension,]]></summary>

On March 7, 2023 from 9:15 AM to 6:31 PM PST, some users may have experienced slow search response times or failed searches.


We made a routine adjustment to our infrastructure that inadvertently increased load and decreased response rates for our search servers. New messages sent during this period were not indexed immediately and would not have been searchable.


We restarted the affected server nodes, returning search performance to normal and allowing the system to catch up on the backlogged indexing tasks. Once the system handled the backlog and we confirmed that indexing was complete, full search functionality was restored to all customers.


Thank you for your patience while we worked through this. We apologize for any disruption to your work.]]></summary>

From February 22nd, 2023 at 2:00 PM until February 24th, 2023 2:16 PM PST, some users experienced issues loading audio files on iOS.


We discovered that the server was returning an unexpected code in response to requests for audio files, causing the app to only partially load the content. We made a change to ensure the server returned the correct response code, resolving the issue for all affected customers.


If you continue to run into any trouble, please feel free to reach out to us at feedback@slack.com.]]></summary>
