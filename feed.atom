On Wednesday, October 26th at 2:15 PM PST Friday to October 28th 9:12 PM PST, some users were unable to view emoji/code previews when hovering their cursor over messages containing emojis. Upon investigation, we discovered that an error had occurred with the jumbomoji (a message with just an emoji) previewer during the process of a backend code-change we were performing related to emoji. Once we learned this, we were able to deploy a fix which rectified this issue for all affected users.]]></summary>

<p>Google engineers are working on a mitigation which is expected to complete by Wednesday, 2022-11-02 17:00 US/Pacific.</p>
  </div><div> <p><strong>Mitigation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If single events appear at the wrong time, manually move the events to the right time.</li>
<li>If recurring events appear at the wrong time, you can make nearly any modification to the series, like adding a space to the summary, and it should fix the events that appear at the wrong time after the transition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Making a modification will also reset any event in the series that had specific changes so that it matches the original event. Some examples of one-off changes that will reset include single events that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were moved to a different time</li>
<li>included other attendees</li>
<li>had a different summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees of recurring events may also see that events they accepted are no longer accepted or that events they declined are no longer declined.</p>
<p>If recurring events appear at the wrong time for some guests, any update to the original event should fix the series for the owner and all of the guests.</p>

Resolved - We have identified an issue with creating room amenity photos. The issue would cause POST requests to fail with either a 404 error or a 500 error. This issue approximately started from last Friday, October 14th, 2022. The photo creations are successful in most cases but the requests fail at a later stage resulting in error responses.
We have fixed this issue at 3:30pm PT today, but there can be duplicate photos created for room amenities during this time. We advise you to review room amenity photos and use the DELETE endpoint to remove duplicate photos.

On October 13, 2022 from 3:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT, a number of customers had trouble loading and receiving thread notifications. Some customers may have also had trouble with loading channels, adding users to group direct messages, API hyperlink rendering, and missing Saved items.


A mass de-provisioning event inadvertently increased load across our infrastructure, causing issues with Threads for many users. 


As an immediate mitigation strategy, we temporarily deactivated the Threads view for all users. 


In parallel, we ended the long running de-provisioning jobs, and significantly scaled up the systems that handle those jobs. We also made several code changes to reduce the effect a de-provisioning job of this scale would have on our infrastructure, and redistributed some of the load across other parts of the system. 


The optimisation and redistribution work brought error rates down, which resolved most of the issues with channel loading, group direct messages, hyperlinks, and Saved items that users were experiencing. 


At this point, we made the call not to re-enable the Threads view in order to give our recovery efforts more time to restore balance to the system. 


Once the load was appropriately balanced across our infrastructure, and we were able to confirm that our up-scaling systems were prepared to handle any future spikes, we re-enabled the Threads view for all users.]]></summary>

Good news! After releasing the new calendar interface, many of you reacted, we thank you for that, and we heard your feedbacks ! 
We did some evolutions to adapt the calendar new interface and make it match your needs. 
What are the main evolutions?
1- More listings displayed
In the first version of new calendar interface the planning was limited to 25 properties, now it goes up to 100 properties.
2- The filters
Few hours after the release we enabled all the 8 filters !
3- The logos more visible
The logos of the sources are now colored in white, it makes them more visible 
Small tip💡
Some of you need to visualize more properties on the planning view.
If you zoom out your calendar page you can make the lines thinner and be able to see more properties.

We invite you to discover all these evolutions, and hope it will help you to have a better management of your calendar, save more time, and make more bookings !
Wishing you all a pleasant day!]]></summary>
