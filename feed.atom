        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Incident began at <strong>2022-10-10 22:18</strong> and ended at <strong>2022-11-07 15:20</strong> <span>(times are in <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong>).</span></p><div class="cBIRi14aVDP__status-update-text"><h1>Incident Report</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On 10 October 2022 at 15:18 PT, Google was alerted to a subset of users experiencing issues with Duo phone number registration with our Google Meet iOS application. Once the root cause was identified, Google pushed out an update to the App Store on 4 November 2022. We believe most users (66%) updated their app by 7 November 2022. To our Google Workspace customers who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>The database version for our Google Meet backend infrastructure uses a specific library to complete the database operations to register or reregister a Duo calling account. An issue with the error-handling mechanism in the library resulted in the backend operations not functioning as intended. This caused affected users to be unable to register or reregister phone numbers, preventing the use of calling features, on the Meet iOS app.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to the situation on 10 October 2022 at 15:18 and immediately started an investigation. Engineers reviewed the Google Meet for iOS app’s feedback logs and identified the root cause as related to registration workflow. Code improvements were identified to handle the app error seen when a user tries to register their account. The fix was deployed in a new version of the iOS app, which was rolled out to the App Store by 4 November 2022. At least 66% of users upgraded to the new version by 7 November 2022.</p>
<p>Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy additional client logging to Meet to report registration-related issues, so we can respond in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Deploy additional monitoring for registration errors reported by the client to more quickly alert us if these types of events happen in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>We apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.</p>
<h2>Detailed Description of Impact</h2>
<p>From 10 October 2022 at 15:18 to 7 November 2022 at 08:20, Google Meet iOS app users may have encountered an “unable to add calling” error when trying to register or reregister their Duo calling account, which resulted in phone numbers not registering as intended.</p>

Severity: Critical
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon tailscaled, which can then be used to remotely execute code.
Affected platforms: Windows
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server.
Who is affected?
All Windows clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node.
Reviewing all logs confirms this vulnerability was not triggered or exploited.

Severity: Low
CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
Description: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access Tailscale environment variables.
Affected platforms: All
Patched Tailscale client versions: v1.32.3 or later, v1.33.257 or later (unstable)
What happened?
In the Tailscale client, the peer API was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in the client, including accessing the node’s Tailscale environment variables.
Who is affected?
All Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
What should I do?
Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.
What is the impact?
An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use that access to read the node’s environment variables, including any credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add new nodes to the user’s tailnet. The peer API access could also be used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via Taildrop.
An attacker with access to the peer API who sent a malicious file via Taildrop which was accessed while it was loading could use this to gain access to the local API, and remotely execute code.
There is no evidence of this vulnerability being purposefully triggered or exploited.

On Wednesday, November 2nd at 2:12 PM PST to 4:34 PM PST, some users were running into issues with publishing a workflow when using Workflow Builder. Clicking the “Next” button would not return any response, and would cause a workflow to remain in its unpublished state. A new code change had been deployed that caused us to exit early in workflow creation and this is now fixed.]]></summary>

On Wednesday, October 26th at 2:15 PM PST Friday to October 28th 9:12 PM PST, some users were unable to view emoji/code previews when hovering their cursor over messages containing emojis. Upon investigation, we discovered that an error had occurred with the jumbomoji (a message with just an emoji) previewer during the process of a backend code-change we were performing related to emoji. Once we learned this, we were able to deploy a fix which rectified this issue for all affected users.]]></summary>
