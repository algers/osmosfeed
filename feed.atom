Nov  3, 20:58 UTC
Monitoring - As of 19:55 UTC, our Engineering team has confirmed that a fix has been implemented by our upstream carrier to mitigate the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. 
We are closely monitoring the situation and will update as soon as we have more information from the provider.
Nov  3, 19:43 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. Upstream congestion with a network provider between Los Angeles and Dallas is impacting traffic traversing out of our SFO datacentres.
A case has been opened by our team with the provider. Our team has attempted to shift traffic to improve the situation, but unfortunately, we continue to see approximately 10% of customer traffic impacted by this issue.
Our team is working on an option to shift to an alternate provider if this issue is not able to be resolved by the provider in a timely manner. We will share another update once we have further information from the provider or we have an update from our Engineering team.
Nov  3, 19:27 UTC
Investigating - As of 17:40 UTC, our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting networking in the SFO regions. During this time, a subset of users may experience packet loss/latency and timeouts with Droplet based services in these regions, including Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Managed Database.

Resolved - A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404â€™s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC.

From 5:01 PM PDT on October 31, 2023 to around 5:54 PM PDT, customers with international data residency in the Paris, France region, experienced issues connecting to Slack and sending messages.


A routine credential rotation caused database sync issues for the Paris, France data residency region. We reverted this code change and restarted the affected databases, resolving the issue for all impacted customers. 


Once we had mitigated the immediate impact and restored connectivity for customers in the Paris, France data residency region, we reviewed the credential rotation for all other data residency regions to ensure the same issue would not occur anywhere else.

Kubernetes operatorâ€™s API proxy allowed authenticated tailnet clients

Tailscale Kubernetes operator version v1.53.37 fixes the issue and
users of the operator who enable the API proxy functionality should
update as described below.
What happened?
The Tailscale Kubernetes operator can optionally act as an API server
proxy
for the clusterâ€™s Kubernetes API. This proxy allows authenticated
tailnet users to use their tailnet identity in Kubernetes
authentication and RBAC rules. The API server proxy uses
impersonation

to translate tailnet identities to Kubernetes identities.
The operator prior to v1.53.37 has two bugs in the forwarding logic,

These classifications are false positives, and we are working with Microsoft to
resolve the situation.
As of 2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC, we have confirmed that Microsoft have addressed
the false positive, meaning Defender no longer flags Tailscale 1.46.1 as
malware. A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.
What happened?
Microsoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware. This caused
Defender to quarantine the binaries, meaning they could not run.
We submitted Tailscale 1.46.1 to Microsoft to investigate the false positive,
who then updated Defender to avoid flagging this release as malware at
2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC.
Who is affected?
People using Defender and Tailscale 1.46.1.
What is the impact?
Tailscale will not run on affected machines.
What do I need to do?
To resolve this issue on your own tailnet, you can take either or both of 2
approaches:
Update to a newer version of Tailscale. Newer versions are not affected by this problem.
Create an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.
Update Microsoft Defender.]]></summary>

Resolved - Copilot completions are currently hosted in 4 regions globally: Central US, France, Switzerland and Japan. Users are typically routed to the nearest geographic region, but may be routed to other regions when the nearest region is unhealthy.
Beginning at 2023-10-25 09:13 UTC, Copilot began experiencing outages of individual regions, lasting 12 minutes per region. These outages were due to the nodes hosting the completion model getting unhealthy due to a recent upgrade. There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors. The outages were partial and varied across the different regions.
In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we are focusing on improving our global load balancing of completion traffic during regional failures, in addition to determining and preventing the root cause of these outages.
Oct 25, 21:37 UTC
Update - The observed Copilot API error rate is around 5% of the requests. As a result, some of the Copilot code suggestions are skipped or not delivered on time.

Resolved - From 10:59 UTC to 13:48 UTC, GitHub Codespaces service was down or degraded due to an outage in our authentication service.This issue impacted 67% of users over this time period.
