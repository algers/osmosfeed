Sounds impossible to find a guest message in seconds ? 
As we keep improving our features, we work closely with property users and managers like yourself to learn how we can help you run your business more efficiently. 
After several workshops, reflections, and feedback, our Smily team did several adjustments to help you use our centralized Inbox in order to simplify this daily communication.
We added several filters to help you find the conversations easily in the Inbox, you can now filter by the following criterias:
Conversation status
Assignee
Guest
Booking stage
Booking status
Rental
Booking tag
Rental tag

This way you can find the exact conversation you are looking for in a matter of seconds :)

Wishing you all a pleasant day!]]></summary>

On January 31, 2023 from 9:44 AM to 3:17 PM PST, some customers may have experienced issues creating new workspaces. 


An error in our onboarding flow meant we were incorrectly assuming new workspaces had completed the onboarding process before any onboarding actually took place, leaving these newly created workspaces in an unusable limbo state. We reverted the change that caused the initial onboarding inconsistencies, then released a fix to resolve some dependencies from the reverted file. 


Everyone should be able to create new workspaces as normal once again, although you may experience some overzealous onboarding prompts as the system resolves any lingering inconsistencies.]]></summary>

On January 24, 2023, from 5:50 AM to 9:30 AM PST, some customers experienced errors when opening threads and saw blank channels and direct message histories.


We traced this issue to an unexpected spike in a database load. We made a configuration change that restored full functionality to threads and conversations for all impacted users.


We are investigating ways to prevent this from occurring in the future.


You may need to reload Slack (Command/Ctrl + Shift + R) in order for the fix to be reflected on your end. We're sorry for the disruption we brought to your day.]]></summary>
