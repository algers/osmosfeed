        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:


On Tuesday February 14th, 2023 from 1:19 AM PST to 3:50 AM PST some customers reported an issue where the API method files.upload created a new message instead of uploading files in a thread.


Our team identified that the cause of the issue was linked to a recent update. This change was rolled back which fixed the issue.

On Monday February 13th, 2023 at 07:00PM to Tuesday February 14th, 2023 at 01:02 AM PST, customers were unable to view threads in public channels they had not joined. This was caused by a recent code change - we've deployed a correction to this and the issue is now resolved.


Should customers continue to experience this behaviour, a hard refresh of the Slack client will fix this.]]></summary>

Resolved - Engineering has implemented mitigations, which should have resolved performance issues. We’ll continue to monitor performance and provide updates if we run into issues again.
We found that page analytics events, such as page views and page edits, did not save during the time of this incident. Impacted users may see their page related analytics as undercounted for February 13, 2023. Our team is looking into how we can prevent this from happening in the future.

Sounds impossible to find a guest message in seconds ? 
As we keep improving our features, we work closely with property users and managers like yourself to learn how we can help you run your business more efficiently. 
After several workshops, reflections, and feedback, our Smily team did several adjustments to help you use our centralized Inbox in order to simplify this daily communication.
We added several filters to help you find the conversations easily in the Inbox, you can now filter by the following criterias:
Conversation status
Assignee
Guest
Booking stage
Booking status
Rental
Booking tag
Rental tag

This way you can find the exact conversation you are looking for in a matter of seconds :)

On January 31, 2023 from 11:40 AM PST to 11:55 AM PST, customers may have experienced issues with workflows not running as expected or posting duplicate messages. 


A network event prevented access to some of the database servers that support workflows. This disruption meant that the remaining servers were unable to handle the workflow load. 


We restarted the affected servers and manually increased the capacity to resolve the issue, restoring normal workflow behaviour.]]></summary>

On January 31, 2023 from 9:44 AM to 3:17 PM PST, some customers may have experienced issues creating new workspaces. 


An error in our onboarding flow meant we were incorrectly assuming new workspaces had completed the onboarding process before any onboarding actually took place, leaving these newly created workspaces in an unusable limbo state. We reverted the change that caused the initial onboarding inconsistencies, then released a fix to resolve some dependencies from the reverted file. 


Everyone should be able to create new workspaces as normal once again, although you may experience some overzealous onboarding prompts as the system resolves any lingering inconsistencies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: An issue in the Tailscale coordination server allowed nodes with expired node keys to continue communicating with other nodes in a tailnet.
What happened?
There was a flaw in Tailscale’s logic for expiring node keys. If the set of nodes that can connect in a tailnet (the netmap) didn’t have any changes, then expired node keys were not immediately removed from the netmap. The longest delay in removal was 19 days, from 2022-12-20 to 2023-01-09.
Who is affected?
All tailnets with nodes whose node keys expired prior to 2023-01-12 may have been affected. Admins of a tailnet can view nodes with expired node keys in the admin console.
What is the impact?
Connections between nodes could continue after a node key expired, both when the expired node key was the source or when it was the destination of a connection. Connections to nodes with expired node keys would only be possible if they met all of the following criteria:
The peer node was in the same tailnet as, or shared into a tailnet with the node with the expired node key;
The peer node and the node with the expired node key were allowed to connect based on the access rules in the tailnet policy file at the time of expiry of the node key;
The tailnet’s netmap, including access rules, nodes added or removed from the tailnet, or connectivity of nodes in the tailnet did not change since the node key expiry; and
Tailscale had not deployed a change to the coordination server since the node key expiry.
What do I need to do?
No action is required. Tailscale has deployed a fix to the coordination server as of 2023-01-11.
Upgrade clients to v1.36 or later for an additional mitigation. In conjunction with the coordination server fix, this mitigation prevents nodes from connecting to nodes with expired node keys if the Tailscale coordination server is offline or unreachable.
