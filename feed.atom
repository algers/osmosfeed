        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:

On October 13, 2022 from 3:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT, a number of customers had trouble loading and receiving thread notifications. Some customers may have also had trouble with loading channels, adding users to group direct messages, API hyperlink rendering, and missing Saved items.


A mass de-provisioning event inadvertently increased load across our infrastructure, causing issues with Threads for many users. 


As an immediate mitigation strategy, we temporarily deactivated the Threads view for all users. 


In parallel, we ended the long running de-provisioning jobs, and significantly scaled up the systems that handle those jobs. We also made several code changes to reduce the effect a de-provisioning job of this scale would have on our infrastructure, and redistributed some of the load across other parts of the system. 


The optimisation and redistribution work brought error rates down, which resolved most of the issues with channel loading, group direct messages, hyperlinks, and Saved items that users were experiencing. 


At this point, we made the call not to re-enable the Threads view in order to give our recovery efforts more time to restore balance to the system. 


Once the load was appropriately balanced across our infrastructure, and we were able to confirm that our up-scaling systems were prepared to handle any future spikes, we re-enabled the Threads view for all users.]]></summary>

Â Â 
Good news! After releasing the new calendar interface, many of you reacted, we thank you for that, and we heard your feedbacks ! 
We did some evolutions to adapt the calendar new interface and make it match your needs. 
What are the main evolutions?
1- More listings displayed
In the first version of new calendar interface the planning was limited to 25 properties, now it goes up to 100 properties.
2- The filters
Few hours after the release we enabled all the 8 filters !
3- The logos more visible
The logos of the sources are now colored in white, it makes them more visible 
Small tipðŸ’¡
Some of you need to visualize more properties on the planning view.
If you zoom out your calendar page you can make the lines thinner and be able to see more properties.

We invite you to discover all these evolutions, and hope it will help you to have a better management of your calendar, save more time, and make more bookings !
Wishing you all a pleasant day!]]></summary>

Identified - We have identified an issue affecting the sending of reservation related webhooks starting on September 15th, we are actively working on it and will post more updates when we have them. This incident does not affect all reservations, only a limited number of them. If you notice that some of your Hosts' reservations webhooks are missing, for example when you accept a make_reservation SAC, but you did not receive a confirmation webhook afterwards, use the GET reservations API to retrieve the reservation status.]]></summary>

From September 26, 2022 at 7:00 AM PDT until September 27, 2022 at 12:40 PM PDT, some Enterprise Grid users were not able to create new webhooks, share posts to a channel, or select a channel from the dropdown menu in Workflow Builder.

On September 26, 2022 from 12:00 PM PDT to 11:48 PM PDT, link formatting was broken for all Slack apps.


Some messages were showing the URL and not a link itself. We determined that this issue was caused by a recent code change that altered how attachment links in the app were formatted.


We reverted this change which fixed the issue for all users after a force reload of Slack.]]></summary>

Â Â 
As you may know, we were pleased to participate in the Vacation Rental World Summit in Porto last week as a Gold Sponsor !
This was the 6th edition of this event, which is becoming increasingly popular each year.
It provides an opportunity for us to meet our partners and customers. We are also always happy and curious to get to know new players in our amazing industry.
These shared moments exchanging with lots of different actors allow us to stay informed about trends and activity in the vacation rental industry.

This year again, this event dedicated to vacation rentals has boosted our collaboration with, among others, our official partners!
At Smily, the quality of our partnerships matters a lot. We want to offer our customers the smoothest integrations and the best assistance we can, from us and from our partners.
We thank our partners who were present at VRWS a lot for the quality of our discussions and their enthusiasm towards our collaboration! :)
