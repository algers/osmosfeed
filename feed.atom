On March 6, 2024 from 7:45 PM PST to around 9:33 PM PST customers reported that they were receiving a 500 error when viewing the legacy Incoming Webhook custom integration page.

We identified a backend code change that inadvertently changed data that the Incoming Webhook page needed to load which consequently caused the page to respond with an HTTP 500 error.

We rolled back the change, correcting the issue and all customers should now be able to access the Incoming Webhook page as expected.]]></summary>

On March 5, 2024 from 6:05 PM PST to March 6, 2024 8:17 AM PST customers on the Windows operating systems reported that Huddles were freezing when screen sharing.
We determined that a recent change that was made to the video codec of Huddles, which may have been moving more of the video encoding to the computer's Graphic Processing Unit. This would cause performance problems & freezing during a screen share.
After narrowing down the exact cause we rolled back the change which restored full functionality to Huddles screen sharing.]]></summary>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Google Workspace users attempting to work within the Admin Console encountered an HTTP 500 error when accessing user or device setting pages within the console. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a change to the access control setting in a backend authentication service used by the Admin Console. This change resulted in users being unable to access the page.</p>
<p>Our Engineering team was alerted by our internal monitoring systems and swiftly mitigated the issue by rolling back the change to the access control settings.</p>
<p>This impacted users ability to view the current user and device policies, change or edit the existing policies and their ability to create new policies.</p>
<p>Google will complete a full Incident Report (IR) in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.</p>

Mar  5, 11:30 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2024-03-05 14:00 UTC
End:  2024-03-05 15:00 UTC
During the above window, we will be performing maintenance in our BLR1 region as part of a firewall migration. This maintenance was previously attempted on 2024-02-19 but the changes were reverted after our Engineers encountered unexpected issues, resulting from the maintenance. Our team has performed a thorough examination of the previous attempt and is confident in performing this maintenance, as well as measures to mitigate any negative outcomes. 
Expected impact:
As part of this maintenance, event processing in BLR1 will be delayed for a period of up to 15 minutes during the one-hour window. During this period, users will experience a delay with creating, destroying, or modifying new or existing DO services in BLR1(such as Droplets, DBaaS/DOKS clusters, etc.), existing services that are running should not be impacted.

Resolved - On March 1, 2024, between 14:17 UTC and 15:54 UTC the service that sends messages from our event stream into our background job processing service was degraded and delayed the transmission of jobs for processing.  No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.
We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.

Mar  1, 16:12 UTC

Mar  1, 15:48 UTC

On February 29, 2024 from 1:28 PM PST to around 4:36 PM PST, users were unable to create or update some workflows.

We determined that a recent code change had inadvertently introduced a logic problem, resulting in errors for workflows that used event triggers. We reverted this code change. However, rolling back reintroduced a separate issue that we'd resolved earlier in the day. 

We prepared a tailored revert to roll back the code causing the workflow problem while also including the fix for the previous issue. This second revert resolved both problems, restoring full functionality to Slack.

Resolved - On February 29, 2024, between 9:32 and 11:54 UTC, queuing in our background job service caused processing delays to Webhooks, Actions, and Issues. Nearly 95% of delays occurred between 11:05 and 11:27 UTC, with 5% during the remainder of the incident. During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.
We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.

Feb 28, 22:23 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has confirmed that the faulty network hardware component was the cause of this issue.

On February 26, 2024 from 9:00 AM PST to 9:36 AM PST, some users experienced problems sending and loading messages in Slack. Others may have completed these actions successfully but more slowly than expected.

Earlier today, we deployed a routine update to part of our network infrastructure. During this work, we deprovisioned some of our proxy servers and provisioned a new set. Some of our webapp servers took longer than expected to sync with the new list of proxy servers, resulting in a spike in connection errors. This coincided with the regular 9:00 AM PST increase in traffic to our servers, which may have exacerbated impact.

By around 9:36 AM PST, error rates had decreased and user impact had completely subsided, most likely due to our automatic scaling functionality. However, we're continuing to analyze data from this event to fully understand the root cause and prevent similar issues in the future.]]></summary>

Resolved - On February 26, 2024, between 18:34 UTC and 19:37 UTC our background job service was degraded and caused job start delays up to 15 minutes. Users experienced delays in Webhooks, Actions, and some UI updates (e.g. a delay in UI updates on pull requests). This was due to capacity problems with our job queueing service, and a failure of our automated failover system.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over to our secondary cluster.   No data was lost - recovery began at 18:55 UTC, when the backlog of enqueued jobs began to process.
We are actively working to repair our failover automation and expand the capacity of our background job queuing service to prevent issues like this in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
Are you connected to VRBO OTA?
Starting today at 2pm UTC, we will be fetching guest reviews and ratings from VRBO, and you'll be able to respond to them directly from Smily interface :)
🚧 Pain Points Addressed:
No need to visit VRBO to check and respond to guest reviews.
Previously, you couldn't rate a guest.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Manage all your reviews in one place.
Easily read and respond to VRBO guest reviews from our Review section on the Smily interface.
Rate guests with ease.
ℹ️ Information and next steps:
We will fetch all your past reviews.


You will be able to rate all past bookings matching those criteria:
--> Bookings without guest review that ended in the last 365 days;
--> Bookings for which a guest review is already present and 14 days haven’t passed since the guest made the review;


Make use of this new feature and ensure to leave reviews for guests. This is an important criterion for VRBO and will impact your property ranking.


Lastly, you can use our "automated reviews" feature, released at the end of last year, for VRBO reviews too.


Have a great review day,
Your Smily team :)]]></summary>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the resolution of the issue impacting the Container Registry in multiple regions. 
Everything involving the Container Registry should now be functioning normally. 
We appreciate your patience throughout the process and if you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team for further review.
Feb 21, 18:03 UTC
Monitoring - Our Engineering team has identified an internal operation within the Container Registry service which was placing load on the service, leading to latency and errors. The team has paused that operation in order to resolve the issue impacting the Container Registry in multiple regions. Users should not be facing any latency issues while interacting with their Container registries and also while building their Apps. 
We are actively monitoring the situation to ensure stability and will provide an update once the incident has been fully resolved. 
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for the inconvenience.
Feb 21, 15:41 UTC
Investigating - Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with the DigitalOcean Container Registry service. Beginning around 20:00 UTC on February 20, there has been an uptick in 401 errors for image pulls from the Container Registry service.
During this time, a subset of customers may experience latency or see 401 errors while interacting with Container Registries. This issue also impacts App Platform builds and users may encounter delays while building their Apps or experience timeout errors in builds as a result. Users utilizing Container Registry for images for deployment to Managed Kubernetes clusters may also see latency or failures to deploy.
We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.]]></summary>

We are thrilled to share with you some great news :)
We are now supporting and managing Booking.com Sponsored Benefit program at Smily;
Benefits for you:
You were facing the obstacle where booking.com **was paying a small amount of the booking.com reservation due to a discount offered to the guest.
1/ it was not blocking the synchronisation of your listing but was creating an issue for the payment;
2/ you had to send manually a payment link to collect the remaining amount to the guests. This won’t be necessary anymore!


Now, as we do support the Sponsored benefit program, you will still see and receive this small amount in advance paid by Booking.com and we will process with success the rest of the payment!


You can now join this program if you were waiting for this functionality 🙂
How does this program benefit your business?
When applied, it offers the following advantages for your business:
Boosts bookings from price-conscious customers
Lowers cancellations with customers paying in advance
Increases your revenue by covering the reduced amount to drive more bookings
Take the next step:
Take a look at what this program is about and check out if you are eligible to enable it and enjoy it;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New!
  
The Airbnb Listing expectation type feature is now available on Smily. 
This update lets you enrich your listings with additional information, directly from Smily's user-friendly interface.
Pain Points Addressed:
Gone are the days of toggling between platforms. Previously, you had to navigate Airbnb's website to update listing details, a time-consuming and inefficient process. Smily's new feature streamlines this, offering a seamless integration within the interface.
🚀 Benefits for you:
Easily accessible under the "amenities" section in the Smily interface, the new "Property Info" category empowers you to select and customize expectation types, with an optional description of up to 100 characters.
This information is then flawlessly synced with Airbnb for those using full synchronization, ensuring a cohesive and accurate listing.
It will also be synchronised on your website if you have one with Smily!
Such information is key and valuable for the guests to avoid any negative surprises on check-in day!
→ Here is where to find this new section on the Smily interface👇
-> Then click on the pen to edit/add an optional description;

ℹ️ Next steps and important information
For those using this via Airbnb, we've already fetched your existing listing expectations from Airbnb as of February 9th.


To ensure data alignment with this new feature, please update any changes made since then before our official release on February 21st via the Smily interface;
→ On February 21st, we will start the synchronisation of your data from Smily to the Airbnb application. Any values not reflected on the Smily interface will be removed from Airbnb.


Please note, that the Smily interface allows a description limit of 100 characters compared to Airbnb's 300. Should this affect your listings, we'll reach out individually.
→ if you cannot update your description before February 21st, let us know please;


Have a great day,
Your Smily team :)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:
On February 12, 2024 from 6:00 AM PST to 8:32 AM PST, some users experienced latency when loading canvases or errors related to editing and saving canvases.

Upon investigation we determined that this was caused by rate limits put in place by an upstream provider. We restarted the impacted endpoints to mitigate the issue immediately, which resolved the issue for all affected users. We're continuing to partner with our upstream provider to reduce the likelihood of this occurring in the future.]]></summary>

Resolved - On Monday February 12th, 2024, 03:00 UTC we deployed a code change to a component of Copilot. At 06:00 UTC we observed an increase in timeouts for code completions impacting 55% of Copilot users at peak across Asia and Europe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feb  9, 11:28 UTC
Resolved - On February 9, 2024 between 10:34 UTC and 11:24 UTC, the Webhooks service was degraded and 63% of webhooks were delayed by up to 16 minutes with an average delay of 5 minutes. No webhook deliveries were lost. This was due to an issue with an overloaded backend data store that was unable to process network requests fast enough.
We mitigated the incident by manually failing over traffic to healthy hosts.
We are expanding the capacity of the backing store as well as making the Webhooks service more resilient to this kind of issue. 

Feb  9, 11:25 UTC
Update - Webhooks is operating normally.
Feb  9, 11:11 UTC
Update - We are investigating latency in processing webhooks. Customers may see a delay of around 5 minutes at this time. We will continue to keep users updated on progress towards mitigation.
Feb  9, 11:09 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Webhooks]]></summary>
