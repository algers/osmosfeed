Nov  3, 20:58 UTC
Monitoring - As of 19:55 UTC, our Engineering team has confirmed that a fix has been implemented by our upstream carrier to mitigate the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. 
We are closely monitoring the situation and will update as soon as we have more information from the provider.
Nov  3, 19:43 UTC
Identified - Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue impacting network connectivity in our SFO region. Upstream congestion with a network provider between Los Angeles and Dallas is impacting traffic traversing out of our SFO datacentres.
A case has been opened by our team with the provider. Our team has attempted to shift traffic to improve the situation, but unfortunately, we continue to see approximately 10% of customer traffic impacted by this issue.
Our team is working on an option to shift to an alternate provider if this issue is not able to be resolved by the provider in a timely manner. We will share another update once we have further information from the provider or we have an update from our Engineering team.
Nov  3, 19:27 UTC
Investigating - As of 17:40 UTC, our Engineering team is investigating an issue impacting networking in the SFO regions.

Resolved - A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete.

What happened?
The Tailscale Kubernetes operator can optionally act as an API server

tailnet users to use their tailnet identity in Kubernetes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Description: Microsoft Defender is flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware.
These classifications are false positives, and we are working with Microsoft to
resolve the situation.
As of 2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC, we have confirmed that Microsoft have addressed
the false positive, meaning Defender no longer flags Tailscale 1.46.1 as
malware. A rescan of tailscaled.exe 1.46.1 on VirusTotal confirms this.
What happened?
Microsoft Defender was flagging Tailscale 1.46.1 as malware. This caused
Defender to quarantine the binaries, meaning they could not run.
We submitted Tailscale 1.46.1 to Microsoft to investigate the false positive,
who then updated Defender to avoid flagging this release as malware at
2023-10-27 1:05 AM UTC.
Who is affected?
People using Defender and Tailscale 1.46.1.
What is the impact?
Tailscale will not run on affected machines.
What do I need to do?
To resolve this issue on your own tailnet, you can take either or both of 2
approaches:
Update to a newer version of Tailscale. Newer versions are not affected by this problem.
Create an exception in Microsoft Defender. Microsoft has published instructions explaining how to do this.
Update Microsoft Defender.]]></summary>

Resolved - Copilot completions are currently hosted in 4 regions globally: Central US, France, Switzerland and Japan. Users are typically routed to the nearest geographic region, but may be routed to other regions when the nearest region is unhealthy.
Beginning at 2023-10-25 09:13 UTC, Copilot began experiencing outages of individual regions, lasting 12 minutes per region. These outages were due to the nodes hosting the completion model getting unhealthy due to a recent upgrade. There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors. The outages were partial and varied across the different regions.
In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we are focusing on improving our global load balancing of completion traffic during regional failures, in addition to determining and preventing the root cause of these outages.
Oct 25, 21:37 UTC
Update - The observed Copilot API error rate is around 5% of the requests. As a result, some of the Copilot code suggestions are skipped or not delivered on time.
Oct 25, 21:19 UTC
Update - We are seeing an impact in the US region as well. We continue the investigation.

Resolved - Our Engineering team has confirmed the resolution of the issue that impacted the Spaces CDN. Objects should be accessible over the CDN endpoint without any issues. However, HTTP/2 is temporarily unavailable due to upstream issues, and due to this HTTP/2 requests should automatically be re-negotiated to 1.1, but in case you experience failures please open a ticket with our support team.
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.

Update - After our upstream provider implemented a remediation step to resolve the issue with the Spaces CDN, the Spaces CDN is serving the objects stored in the Spaces bucket without any errors or performance issues. However, we are still monitoring the situation closely and we'll share more in…]]></summary>

Resolved - Our Engineering team has resolved the issue with the Managed Kubernetes Service. A daemonset has been released to all existing clusters eliminating the auto-update process and it will be removed again going forward. If you find worker nodes that could still be affected by a prior occurrence of this incident, please replace them for permanent mitigation.
If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Resolved - On October 9, 2023 at 14:24 UTC, a noticeable delay in commits appearing in pull requests was detected.  During the incident, approximately 9% of pull requests (less than the 20% first reported) experienced staleness of up to 7m. The root cause was identified to be an increase in the latency of a downstream dependency causing pull request workers to saturate their available capacity, resulting in delayed updates to PRs - no data was lost during this incident.
	We mitigated this by adding additional capacity to the affected worker pool at 15:02 UTC. This allowed our background jobs to catch up with the backlog of updates and provide relief to our customers. Additionally, we have significantly increased the performance of the downstream service to prevent recurrence
Oct  9, 14:52 UTC
Update - We are investigating delays for commits showing up on Pull Requests page loads in the web UI. As a result of this,  about 20% of pull requests are currently showing stale data of up-to 7m. We are currently investigating contributing factors right now.
Oct  9, 14:51 UTC
Investigating - We are investigating reports of degraded performance for Pull Requests]]></summary>
