Aug  9, 20:01 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Aug  6, 14:36 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-08-09 20:00 UTC
End:  2023-08-10 00:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SGP1 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase.
Expected impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Issue summary:

On August 2, 2023 from 9:01 AM PDT to 11:00 AM PDT, customers may have experienced issues with blurry images in Slack, as well as trouble uploading files. A small percentage of customers may have also experienced errors or slowness when loading channels, sending messages, accessing admin pages, and connecting to Slack.


An issue with a routine database cluster migration inadvertently caused a decrease in capacity. Unfortunately, this coincided with a scheduled job to process a large number of custom status requests, an activity that commonly occurs at the top of each hour. The number of incoming requests exceeded the unintentionally reduced capacity of the database cluster, leading to errors and sluggishness for some actions in Slack. As these requests piled up, other Slack services began to experience issues as well, including a small number of users being unable to connect.


We paused the scheduled custom status job to immediately mitigate the load on the affected database cluster. This resolved some of the errors affecting Slack services. Once we established we had sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled job, we resumed processing the custom status requests, fully restoring normal service for all affected users.


Once the load was balanced and custom status processing had returned to normal, we deployed a fix to correct the issue with the database cluster migration, bringing capacity back to the expected level.]]></summary>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>On 24 July 2023 at 07:50, following a Google Classroom iOS app update,  the app would not load properly if users attempted to access any course page that had attached materials for a duration of 1 day, 20 hours, 25 minutes. During the disruption, users were able to access course pages by uninstalling and reinstalling the Classroom iOS app.</p>
<h2>Root Cause</h2>
<p>The root cause has been identified as a bug, triggered by an update released for Classroom iOS, that caused an issue with the local database migration. This caused the iOS app to not load properly when users attempted to access course pages with attached materials, as the migration was specific to the materials configuration.</p>
<h2>Remediation and Prevention</h2>
<p>Google engineers were alerted to the issue via internal monitoring on 24 July 2023 at 07:50 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers reproduced the issue,  identified the trigger as a failed database migration, and paused the auto update. This prevented any further disruption. An app update with a fix was released for the Classroom iOS app, thereby resolving the issue on 26 July 2023 at 04:15 US/Pacific. Users who had already updated to the problematic app version were advised to either uninstall and reinstall or update the app to the version with the fix.</p>
<p>Google is committed to preventing recurrence by implementing the following action items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement additional pre-release migration and application testing plans to validate app stability</li>
</ul>

We determined this issue was caused by a recent code change related to how canvases persist across sessions. We issued a code update which resolved the issue for all impacted users.

We are also working on deploying a subsequent code update intended to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future.]]></summary>

On July 27, 2023 between 2:03 AM PDT - 2:59 AM PDT, Slack was experiencing a systemwide issue during which users were not able to send or receive messages across multiple platforms. 


Our engineering team identified an issue after a change was made to a service that manages our internal system communication. This resulted in degradation of Slack functionality until the change was reverted which resolved the issue for all users. 


We are currently hard at work on scoping measures to prevent this from happening in the future. More information about remediation and prevention steps will be included in an upcoming RCA which you can request by writing into feedback@slack.com.]]></summary>

Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-27 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-27 05:00 UTC

During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This will be the second of the two maintenance activities performed by our team in the region on consecutive days.
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavour to keep any such impact to a minimum.

On July 25th, 2023 from 3:00 PM PDT to 6:00 PM PDT we received reports of existing members unable to invite new members to workspaces. We traced the cause of issue to a recent code change which prevented emails from being sent. This also impacted logins, workspace creation and potentially other email-based processes.

Completed - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.
Jul 26, 01:00 UTC
In progress - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.
Jul 25, 23:09 UTC
Scheduled - Start: 2023-07-26 01:00 UTC
End: 2023-07-26 05:00 UTC
During the above window, our Networking team will be making changes to our core networking infrastructure to improve performance and scalability in the SFO3 region. This maintenance will occur in two parts on consecutive days and we will send another maintenance notice for the second phase. 
Expected Impact:
These upgrades are designed and tested to be seamless and we do not expect any impact to customer traffic due to this maintenance. If an unexpected issue arises, affected Droplets and Droplet-based services may experience a temporary loss of private connectivity between VPCs. We will endeavor to keep any such impact to a minimum.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this maintenance, please reach out to us by opening up a ticket on your account via https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/createticket.]]></summary>

Identified - We have identified an issue that caused reservations to be created without associated threads. This occurred between 10:15 PM and 11:29 PM on July 12th (PST), so notifications for reservations created during that time were sent with a null `thread_id` value.
We are actively working on creating threads for reservations that do not have them, and will update here afterwards.

We would like to inform you that we will deploy a nice improvement to your websites.
Starting today, all Smily websites will be under SSL certificates.
There is nothing you have to do on your side, this change will be automatic and shall not impact your website’s accessibility.
What does it mean ?
Your website’s URL will be starting with https:// and no longer http://.
What are the benefits of this change ?
Websites are more secured
Better user experience
Users stay longer and buy more on secured websites
Sites with HTTPS load faster
HTTPS leads to accurate SEO reporting
Better SEO : SSL is a positive ranking factor for Google. Google’s team has expressed the need for HTTPS time and time again. So much so that they’ve released an algorithm update based on it—causing sites without HTTPS security to struggle on their quest to rank highly in the search engines results.
Feel free to reach out to us if you have any question !]]></summary>
